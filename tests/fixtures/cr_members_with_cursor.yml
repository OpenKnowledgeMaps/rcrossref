        The pneumonia severity index (PSI) accounts for many comorbidities, but not
        immunosuppression.<\/jats:p><jats:p>OBJECTIVES: To document the utility of
        the PSI to predict mortality in immunocompromised patients (IP) with community-acquired
        pneumonia (CAP).<\/jats:p><jats:p>METHODS: Charts of 284 patients with immunosuppression
        and CAP were reviewed, and these patients were compared with a contemporary
        sample of non-IP with CAP. The ability of the PSI to predict mortality was
        assessed by using multiple logistic regression. Discrimination of the PSI
        was studied by using the concordance index.<\/jats:p><jats:p>RESULTS: Thirty-nine
        of 284 IP died. Mortality varied according to the etiology of the immunosuppression.
        Patients with HIV, solid organ transplantation or treatment with immunosuppressive
        drugs (n=118) had a low in-hospital mortality (4.3%) and were classified as
        low risk. IP with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy, chest radiation
        or marrow transplantation (n=166) had a high mortality (20%) and were classified
        as high risk. Compared with non-IP, low-risk IP had similar PSI-controlled
        mortality (OR=0.9, P=0.80), whereas high-risk IP had significantly greater
        mortality (OR=2.8, P&lt;0.0001). The concordance index revealed similar discrimination
        for the PSI in low-risk IP (0.77) and in non-IP (0.7), but inferior discrimination
        in high-risk patients (0.6).<\/jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CAP
        and immunosuppression can be divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The
        low-risk IP have mortality similar to non-IP and can be risk stratified by
        using the PSI.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2006\/195464","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]],"date-time":"2016-03-15T07:50:56Z","timestamp":1458028256000},"page":"89-93","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":25,"title":["Pneumonia

        the necessary condition for the divergence-free property of the magnetic induction
        field in the whole space, known as solenoidality condition, directly comes
        from the conservation of total momentum for the system, that is, sources and
        field. This work, in general, leads to results that leave some open questions
        on the existence, or at least the observability, of magnetic monopoles, theoretically

        were enrolled. TBNA and conventional diagnostic techniques (CDTs: forceps
        biopsy, brushing, and washing) were performed in all patients. Endobronchial
        lesions were classified into exophytic mass lesions (EMLs), submucosal disease
        (SD), and peribronchial disease (PD). The diagnostic yields of TBNA and CDT
        alone and together were compared according to the lesions\u2019 types, histopathology,
        and locations. During 3-year period, the addition of TBNA to CDT improved
        bronchoscopic sensitivity from 70.2% to 94.7% in all lesion types. Addition
        of TBNA to CDT increased the diagnostic success from 74% to 95% and from 50%

        in all localizations by the addition of TBNA to CDT, particularly for lesions

        addition of TBNA to CDT increases the diagnostic yield in patients with visible

        vehicle has gained increasing attention due to its high cruise speed and long
        voyage. In this paper, an enhanced Sequential Approximate Optimization method
        is proposed for aerodynamic optimization of a hypersonic vehicle. In this
        method, a constrained design of experiment method is adopted to generate the
        initial sampling set with adequate number of feasible points. A field metamodel
        is proposed to surrogate the aerodynamic parameters distributions in the flow
        field obtained by the aerodynamic simulation. A hybrid metamodel combing radial
        basis functions and polynomial chaos expansion is applied to construct the
        field metamodel with good approximate performance. A robust mesh morphing
        scheme based on radial basis functions is developed to generate high-quality
        meshes for the sequential optimization scheme. The hypersonic vehicle aerodynamic
        optimization problem is performed using the proposed optimization framework
        and satisfactory results are obtained with limited computational budgets.
        Results show that the proposed field metamodel-enhanced Sequential Approximate
        Optimization method possesses powerful optimization performance and promising
        prospects in the field of hypersonic vehicle optimization design.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8889593","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]],"date-time":"2021-03-17T14:50:09Z","timestamp":1615992609000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Hypersonic

        A tag library was created using the LongSAGE method and consisted of 14,208

        sequences of genes, while 82% (1,349\/1,645) identified one or more genomic

        Sorafenib is an anticancer drug used in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular
        carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. It is a substrate for the human
        OATP1B1. This study is aimed at assessing the role of OATP1B1 in transportation
        and uptake of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma and how OATP1B1 affects
        the pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. Methods. Sorafenib

        cells, as well as in HepG2 cells transfected with miR-148a mimics. The viability
        and apoptosis rate of cells treated with sorafenib were evaluated. A liver
        cancer rat model was established to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
        of sorafenib after overexpression of Oatp2. Results. Changes in expression
        and genetic mutations of OATP1B1 significantly affected the uptake of sorafenib
        in HepG2 and LO2 transgenic cells, and the uptake of sorafenib was higher
        in HepG2 than LO2. Genetic mutations of OATP1B1 significantly affected the
        cell viability and apoptosis rate of HepG2 cells after sorafenib treatment.
        Compared to control group, the uptake of sorafenib in miR-148a mimic-transfected
        HepG2 cells was decreased, and the cell viability was increased. PCN significantly
        increased the expression of Oatp2 and affected the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib.
        Vascular endothelial growth factor levels and microvascular density in tumor-adjacent
        tissues decreased significantly, suggesting that increased Oatp2 expression
        improves the treatment effect of sorafenib in a rat model of liver cancer.
        Conclusions. OATP1B1 plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
        of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/9711179","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,26]],"date-time":"2021-09-26T19:09:39Z","timestamp":1632683379000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["OATP1B1

        in area, and has a summit depth of 1260\u2009m. The sea bottom water temperature
        is . The gas hydrate crystals generally have the form of flakes or rice, some
        larger aggregates of them are up to 2\u2009cm across. A pressure core taken
        at the site contained 3.1 lt. of hydrocarbon gases composed of methane, nearly
        devoid of propane and butane. The sediment had a gas hydrate occupancy of
        0.7% of the core volume. These characteristics place the gas hydrate field
        at Thessaloniki MV at the upper boundary of the gas hydrate stability zone,

        Orc1\/Cdc6 is involved in nuclear DNA replication, and, despite its involvement
        in such a conserved process, Orc1\/Cdc6 is distinct from mammalian Orc1 and

        mathematical model is proposed and analysed to study the dynamics of two-prey
        one predator system of fishery model with Holling type II function response.
        The effect of harvesting was incorporated to both populations and thoroughly
        analysed. We study the ecological dynamics of the Nile perch, cichlid, and
        tilapia fishes as prey-predator system of lake Victoria fishery in Tanzania.
        In both cases, by nondimensionalization of the system, the equilibrium points
        are computed and conditions for local and global stability of the system are
        obtained. Condition for local stability was obtained by eigenvalue approach
        and Routh-Hurwitz Criterion. Moreover, the global stability of the coexistence
        equilibrium point is proved by defining appropriate Lyapunov function. Bioeconomic
        equilibrium is analysed and numerical simulations are also carried out to
        verify the analytical results. The numerical results indicate that the three
        species would coexist if cichlid and tilapia fishes will not be overharvested
        as these populations contribute to the growth rates of Nile perch population.
        The fishery control management should be exercised to avoid overharvesting
        of cichlid and tilapia fishes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/2601648","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,2]],"date-time":"2019-06-02T23:32:12Z","timestamp":1559518332000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Modeling

        recent years, amounts of permutation-diffusion architecture-based image cryptosystems
        have been proposed. However, the key stream elements in the diffusion procedure
        are merely depending on the secret key that is usually fixed during the whole
        encryption process. Cryptosystems of this type suffer from unsatisfactory
        encryption speed and are considered insecure upon known\/chosen plaintext
        attacks. In this paper, an efficient diffusion scheme is proposed. This scheme
        consists of two diffusion procedures, with a supplementary diffusion procedure
        padded after the normal diffusion. In the supplementary diffusion module,
        the control parameter of the selected chaotic map is altered by the resultant
        image produced after the normal diffusion operation. As a result, a slight
        difference in the plain image can be transferred to the chaotic iteration
        and bring about distinct key streams, and hence totally different cipher images
        will be produced. Therefore, the scheme can remarkably accelerate the diffusion
        effect of the cryptosystem and will effectively resist known\/chosen plaintext
        attacks. Theoretical analyses and experimental results prove the high security
        performance and satisfactory operation efficiency of the proposed scheme.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/427349","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,31]],"date-time":"2014-03-31T21:16:43Z","timestamp":1396300603000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["An

        years have witnessed renewed interest in developing skin segmentation approaches.
        Skin feature segmentation has been widely employed in different aspects of
        computer vision applications including face detection and hand gestures recognition
        systems. This is mostly due to the attractive characteristics of skin colour
        and its effectiveness to object segmentation. On the contrary, there are certain
        challenges in using human skin colour as a feature to segment dynamic hand
        gesture, due to various illumination conditions, complicated environment,
        and computation time or real-time method. These challenges have led to the
        insufficiency of many of the skin color segmentation approaches. Therefore,
        to produce simple, effective, and cost efficient skin segmentation, this paper
        has proposed a skin segmentation scheme. This scheme includes two procedures
        for calculating generic threshold ranges in Cb-Cr colour space. The first
        procedure uses threshold values trained online from nose pixels of the face
        region. Meanwhile, the second procedure known as the offline training procedure
        uses thresholds trained out of skin samples and weighted equation. The experimental
        results showed that the proposed scheme achieved good performance in terms
        of efficiency and computation time.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2017\/7645189","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,2]],"date-time":"2017-03-02T21:00:44Z","timestamp":1488488444000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Low

        Background Several studies have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) and oxidised
        low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) are critical factors in atherosclerosis.
        In this study, we examined the molecular basis of mutually facilitative interactions
        between Ang II and ox-LDL in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).
        <\/jats:p><jats:p> Methods and results We observed that incubation of cultured
        HCAECs with Ang II (10-12 to 10-6 M) for 24 hours caused a concentration-dependent
        increase in the expression of mRNA and protein of a specialised receptor for
        ox-LDL (LOX-1). These effects of Ang II were completely blocked by pretreatment
        of HCAECs with candesartan (10-6 M), a specific AT1-receptor blocker, but
        not by PD 123319 (10-6 M), a specific AT2-receptor blocker. On the other hand,
        incubation of HCAECs with ox-LDL (10 and 40 \u00b5g\/ml) for 24 hours progressively
        upregulated AT1-, but not AT 2-, receptor mRNA and protein. Pretreatment of
        cells with the anti-oxidant alpha-tocopherol (1\u20145 x 10-6 M) inhibited
        the upregulation of AT1-receptor expression induced by ox-LDL (p&lt;0.05).
        To determine the significance of expression of AT1-receptors and LOX-1, we
        measured cell injury in response to Ang II and ox-LDL. Incubation of cells
        with both ox-LDL and Ang II synergistically increased cell injury, measured
        as cell viability and LDH release, compared with either ox-LDL or Ang II alone
        (both p&lt;0.05). Alpha-tocopherol, as well as candesartan, attenuated cell
        injury in response to Ang II and ox-LDL (both p&lt;0.05). <\/jats:p><jats:p>
        Conclusions These observations show that Ang II upregulates a novel endothelial
        receptor for ox-LDL (LOX-1) gene expression and ox-LDL in turn upregulates
        Ang II AT 1receptor gene expression. This interaction between Ang II and ox-LDL
        further augments cell injury in HCAECs. These findings provide basis for the
        use of AT1-receptor blockers and anti-oxidants in designing therapy for atherosclerosis
        and myocardial ischaemia. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/14703203010020011201","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,30]],"date-time":"2010-09-30T13:43:59Z","timestamp":1285854239000},"page":"S70-S76","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Facilitative

        concentration, adsorbent dose, ionic strength, pH, and temperature. Langmuir
        and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to the equilibrium data. The data
        fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm (). The maximum monolayer adsorption
        capacity () was found to be 20.96\u2009mg\/g at an initial pH of 7.2. The
        temperature variation study showed that dye adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous
        with increased randomness at the solid solution interface. The results indicated
        that sugarcane stalks could be an alternative for more costly adsorbents used
        for dye removal. The kinetic of the adsorption process followed the pseudo

        photoelectrochemical response and catalytic efficiency towards phenol photooxidation
        of mesoporous titania particles with spherical morphology have been explored.
        The catalysts were synthesized in two different arrangements using carbon
        spheres in a dual role as support and morphology director: hollow spherical
        titania particles and dense structures where the titania shell is surrounding
        a carbon core. Although the synthesized titania hollow spheres exhibited a
        similar photoelectrochemical behavior and optical properties than commercial
        P25, they showed a better photocatalytic response towards phenol photo-oxidation
        in terms of pollutant mineralization. This behavior cannot be explained in
        terms of the crystallinity (found to be higher for P25) and has been attributed
        to both confinement effects in the mesoporosity of these catalysts as well
        as to the spherical morphology of titania particles. The spherical arrangement
        of the titania surface would favor the fast motion of the charge carriers
        and minimize recombination processes. On the other hand, no clear contribution
        of the carbon phase to the enhanced photocatalytic response, since quite similar
        performance is observed for the hollow spheres and the core\/shell composite.
        However, separation and filtration of the catalysts become easier for the
        carbon\/titania composite, thereby improving the so-called practical efficiency.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2013\/178512","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,11,26]],"date-time":"2012-11-26T21:07:54Z","timestamp":1353964074000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Tuning

        To explore the influencing factors of medication compliance in patients with
        recurrent vertebral fractures after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and the
        role of family-centered education intervention. Methods. From January 2018
        to January 2021, the general disease-related data survey form and medication
        compliance questionnaire made by our hospital were used to evaluate the scores
        of 198 patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after PKP in the Department
        of Orthopedics of our hospital. Single-factor and multiple linear regression
        analyses were used to explore the influencing factors of medication compliance
        in patients with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP. From 198 patients,
        80 eligible patients were selected for further research. According to a random
        number table method, they were divided into the control group (n\u2009=\u200940)
        given only antiosteoporosis drug treatment and care and the experimental group
        (n\u2009=\u200940) combined with family-centered education intervention. After
        12 months of intervention, the two groups were evaluated for their knowledge
        of osteoporosis, medication compliance, and physical health. Results. Of the
        198 patients, only 65 had good medication compliance, 90 had poor medication
        compliance, and 43 were acceptable. Univariate analysis showed that the influencing
        factors of medication compliance in patients with recurrent vertebral fractures
        after PKP include the patient\u2019s education, living style, per capita monthly
        income, combined other diseases, number of hospitalizations, and time since
        the last hospitalization (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        Multiple linear regression analysis showed that patients with recurring vertebral
        fractures after PKP with high education, living with spouse or children, combined
        with other diseases, frequent hospitalizations, and short time from the last
        hospitalization had higher medication compliance (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        After the intervention, the disease knowledge mastery of the experimental
        group was significantly better than before and after the intervention in the
        control group (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        After the intervention, the medication compliance and health status of the
        experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group
        (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M4\">\n                        <mi>P<\/mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;<\/mo>\n                        <mn>0.05<\/mn>\n                     <\/math>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula>).
        Conclusion. The medication compliance of patients with recurrent vertebral
        fractures after PKP is generally poor, and medical staff need to take targeted
        interventions based on the main factors that affect the patients\u2019 medication
        compliance. Family-centered education intervention is an effective way to
        improve disease awareness, medication compliance, and health status of patients
        with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3974674","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]],"date-time":"2021-10-22T22:13:09Z","timestamp":1634940789000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Analysis

        study assesses the impacts of wave action and freshwater outflow on soft-bottom
        benthic macrofauna spatial distribution and temporal stability along the highly
        exposed French Basque coast. Sediment characteristics and macrofauna abundance
        have been seasonally investigated during two years for nine stations located
        at the same (6\u2009m) depth and spread over three subtidal sites showing
        distinct exposure levels. Wave climate has been determined through an operational
        numerical model. A total of 121 taxa were recorded, gathered in three main
        faunal assemblages, as revealed by classification and ordination methods.
        Non-parametric multivariate multiple regression (distance-based linear model)
        showed that the variations in macrofaunal distribution can be explained by
        hydrodynamic conditions. Wave exposure strongly linked to estuarine inputs
        were the most relevant abiotic factors influencing distributional patterns
        and functional structure as described by biological traits analysis. Despite
        the influence of these abiotic variables affecting sedimentary dynamics, seasonal
        stability was observed in macrobenthic assemblages composition suggesting
        an ability to recover from natural disturbances such as (e.g.) winter storms.
        In this way, these results provide baseline knowledge for future ecosystem
        and resource management in shallow subtidal areas strongly exposed to swell
        and freshwater outflow where soft-bottom macrozoobenthic communities are less
        frequently studied.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/4674580","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,30]],"date-time":"2020-01-30T23:31:13Z","timestamp":1580427073000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Hydrodynamic

        paper investigates the effect of a change in life expectancy (i.e., longevity)
        on fertility in a standard OLG economy. The main result is that, in contrast
        with other papers, an increase in the longevity rate may increase the fertility
        rate as well. It is shown that such a result holds when the cost of rearing
        children in terms of goods and services (rather than in terms of forgone wages)
        matters. In particular, such a result depends on the relative \u201cstrength\u201d
        of the capital in the technology as compared with the \u201cstrength\u201d
        of the parsimony. Moreover it is shown, again in contrast with other papers,
        that with an unfunded social security system it is more likely that a longer
        life may increase the fertility. The latter result is even more likely in
        the presence of child subsidy policies, which are widespread in developed
        countries. In conclusion, we argue that in countries having a population with
        a high longevity, a high capital share, a large unfunded social security,
        and child subsidy policies (such as Italy), a further increase of longevity
        may increase fertility in the long run and thus partially alleviate the peril

        the rapid development of computer technology, people have begun to combine
        virtual reality and other technologies to achieve scientific sports auxiliary
        training, to get rid of the state of traditional sports training purely relying
        on experience. The article proposes a deep learning BP neural network human
        body posture recognition algorithm and briefly introduces the human body motion
        posture. The purpose of this research was to use the powerful data processing,
        mining, and analysis functions of deep learning to train the massive data
        generated in competitive sports training and apply it to competitive sports
        training. It is committed to promoting the accuracy and analysis of competitive
        sports training. Refinement provides technical guidance for athletes\u2019
        training, promotes the scientific and informatized development of competitive
        sports training in China, and provides some reference methods for the research
        and application of deep learning in competitive sports training. The article\u2019s
        research results show that (1) taking a rural area as an example, we recorded
        the exercise postures of rural athletes in five different states: static,
        upstairs, downstairs, walking, and running. Comparing the recognition rate
        and training time of The BP neural network algorithm, ABC-BP algorithm, AFS-BP
        algorithm, and ABC-AFS-BP algorithm, it can be found that in terms of recognition
        rate, ABC-AFS-BP algorithm, AFS-BP algorithm, and ABC-BP algorithm are better
        than traditional BP algorithm. Among them, the recognition rate of the ABC-AFS-BP
        algorithm is higher than that of the ABC-BP algorithm, but it takes slightly
        more time than the ABC-BP algorithm. In terms of training time, the ABC-BP
        algorithm takes less time, but the accuracy is lower than the ABC-AFS-BP algorithm;
        the ABC-AFS-BP algorithm has a greater improvement in time consumption than
        the AFS-BP model and can guarantee the recognition rate and accuracy, and
        the error rate curves of the four algorithms show that after 500 iterations
        of the training part, the iteration error value of the ABC-AFS-BP algorithm
        is the smallest. (2) We evaluated sports postures of athletes from a certain
        rural team and concluded that bad postures will have a certain impact on the
        body. Among them, more than 85% of athletes in football and basketball have
        pelvic rotation. The problem is that football players have reached 90% of
        the test sample. 60% of football players and basketball players have the problem
        of collapsed foot. The main problem of aerobic athletes is flat back and collapsed
        foot. More than 90% of badminton players have high and low shoulder problems,
        and more than 80% of them have neck problems, which is a very serious body
        posture problem. (3) Detecting the flexibility experiment of the BP posture
        detection algorithm, compared with the traditional motion posture recording
        method, we tested from the three aspects of recording motion accuracy, missed
        detection rate, and recording time. The result shows BP posture detection.
        The missing detection rate of the algorithm is low, basically maintained at
        about 2.0, the accuracy of recording actions is relatively high, generally
        maintained above 98%, and the highest is 99.15%, and the recording time is
        short, maintained at 3\u20134\u2009minutes; comparing traditional posture
        detection with the BP attitude detection algorithm, the missed detection rate
        of the algorithm is relatively high, kept at 4\u20136, the action accuracy
        is lower than that of the BP attitude detection algorithm, generally kept
        at about 95%, and the recording time is kept at 5\u20136\u2009minutes. The
        posture detection algorithm is more efficient.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/5916301","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,4]],"date-time":"2022-03-04T21:05:06Z","timestamp":1646427906000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Research

        helium burning phase represents the second stage that the star used to consume
        nuclear fuel in its interior. In this stage, the three elements, carbon, oxygen,
        and neon, are synthesized. The present paper is twofold: firstly, it develops
        an analytical solution to the system of the conformable fractional differential
        equations of the helium burning network, where we used, for this purpose,
        the series expansion method and obtained recurrence relations for the product
        abundances, that is, helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon. Using four different
        initial abundances, we calculated 44 gas models covering the range of the
        fractional parameter<jats:inline-formula><math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        We found that the effects of the fractional parameter on the product abundances
        are small which coincides with the results obtained by a previous study. Secondly,
        we introduced the mathematical model of the neural network (NN) and developed
        a neural network algorithm to simulate the helium burning network using a
        feed-forward process. A comparison between the NN and the analytical models
        revealed very good agreement for all gas models. We found that NN could be
        considered as a powerful tool to solve and model nuclear burning networks
        and could be applied to the other nuclear stellar burning networks.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6662217","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]],"date-time":"2021-03-17T00:05:29Z","timestamp":1615939529000},"page":"1-18","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Conformable

        research was aimed to study CT image features based on the backprojection
        filtering reconstruction algorithm and evaluate the effect of ropivacaine
        combined with dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine on assisted thoracoscopic
        lobectomy to provide reference for clinical diagnosis. A total of 110 patients
        undergoing laparoscopic resection were selected as the study subjects. Anesthesia
        induction and nerve block were performed with ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone
        and dexmedetomidine before surgery, and chest CT scan was performed. The backprojection
        image reconstruction algorithm was constructed and applied to patient CT images
        for reconstruction processing. The results showed that when the overlapping
        step size was 16 and the block size was 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932, the running
        time of the algorithm was the shortest. The resolution and sharpness of reconstructed
        images were better than the Fourier transform analytical method and iterative
        reconstruction algorithm. The detection rates of lung nodules smaller than
        6\u2009mm and 6\u201330\u2009mm (92.35% and 95.44%) were significantly higher
        than those of the Fourier transform analytical method and iterative reconstruction
        algorithm (90.98% and 87.53%; 88.32% and 90.87%) (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        After anesthesia induction and lobectomy with ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone

        after five days. In summary, ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine
        had better sedation and analgesia effects in patients with thoracoscopic lobectomy.

        and water-to-cement ratio have significant influences on rheology of cement
        grouts. In order to study effects of time and water-to-cement ratio on rheology
        of Bingham cement grouts, taking Bingham cement grouts widely used in practical
        engineering (cement grouts with water-to-cement ratio of 0.75\u20131.25) as
        research object, some rheological experiments of five cement grouts with water-to-cement
        ratio of 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.25 were carried out at six moments of 0,
        5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. Combining theoretical discussion
        with numerical analysis, influence of coupling effects of time and water-to-cement
        ratio on rheological properties of Bingham cement grouts was discussed. Results
        show that at the level of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, time has a significant
        influence on plastic viscosity but has no significant influence on the yield
        stress of Bingham cement grouts. Water-to-cement ratio has a significant influence
        on both plastic viscosity and yield stress. Exponential models obtained by
        comprehensive analysis from statistical theory, practical applicability, and
        accuracy are the optimal models to describe quantitative change in the relationship
        of coupling effects of time and water-to-cement ratio on plastic viscosity
        and yield stress of Bingham cement grouts. The rheological equation considering
        coupling effects of time and water-to-cement ratio of Bingham cement grouts
        is constructed. Research achievements not only have certain theoretical significance
        to the development and improvement of fluid mechanics and theoretical system
        of penetration grouting but also provide theoretical support and technical
        reference for practical grouting engineering and also have certain practical
        significance for solving or improving the practical engineering problems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5781753","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,23]],"date-time":"2021-10-23T19:20:09Z","timestamp":1635016809000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Influence

        In all, 6044 patients were recruited and provided with a questionnaire about

        proposed based on the shear fatigue damage accumulation at the coating-substrate
        interface. The life of a small-caliber gun barrel is predicted by use of constant
        tensile strength at normal temperature and temperature-dependent tensile strength,

        that the reduction of interface tensile strength due to temperature rise in
        the firing process is an important inducement of interface damage and gun
        barrel failure. When the temperature-dependent tensile strength is considered
        in life prediction model, the prediction results are smaller than that predicted
        by use of constant tensile strength and well matched with the life test results.

        systems for site-selective RNA scission have been prepared by combining Lu(III)

        order to improve the security and robustness of the Information Steganography
        Algorithm under strictly controlled environment, a new algorithm of modification-free
        steganography based on image and big data is introduced in this paper. In
        the proposed algorithm, a mapping relationship between the hot image entropy
        and the secret information is constructed and the payload information is expressed
        by the mapping relation. At the same time, turbo code is introduced in order
        to improve robustness, the hot image comes from Internet image big data, and
        the library of hot image is established. The performance of the proposed algorithm
        is analyzed using simulation experiment. Because of its none-modifying on
        carrier image, the results of experiment show that the proposed algorithm
        can achieve good performance in robustness analysis, dimension scaling attack,
        and rotation attack. In particular, in the test of dimension scaling attack
        and the rotation attack, the rate of data recovering can be over 95%. The
        proposed algorithm can be very valuable in the covert communication which
        requires high security and low volume, for example, the key exchange of symmetric
        encryption system.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/6256872","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,26]],"date-time":"2018-03-26T19:31:26Z","timestamp":1522092686000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["A

        simply supported composite trusses with different configurations of shear
        connection (<jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>) were evaluated via three-point
        bending tests. The effects of the shear connectors\u2019 configuration on
        the flexural response (i.e., load-deflection, load-slippage, and load-strain
        curves) of the composite trusses were examined. The commercial finite-element
        (FE) software ANSYS was employed to conduct numerical simulations. An FE model
        was developed for the composite truss and was validated using experimental
        results. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of the
        shear connectors\u2019 configuration on the flexural response of the composite
        trusses. If <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>\u2009&lt;\u20091, the bending
        capacity increased with <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>. In contrast, if
        <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>\u2009\u2265\u20091, the effect of <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>
        on the bending capacity was negligible. Finally, a design method based on
        the degree of the shear connection was proposed to predict the ultimate capacity
        of the composite truss, and the predictions agreed well with the experimental
        results.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/1502707","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,12]],"date-time":"2019-06-12T19:30:34Z","timestamp":1560367834000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Flexural

        the field of modern manufacturing, probes have been playing a more and more
        crucial role. However, contact probes are unfit for measuring objects with
        soft surfaces or very tiny cavities and require radius compensation of stylus.
        In comparison, noncontact probes such as optical probes do not have to consider
        these problems and are well-performed in measurement. However, existing optical
        probes (triangulation) may fail to detect objects with rich spatial structures
        (due to the occlusion effect) and highly reflective curved surfaces (due to
        existence of highlight spots). Considering the problems, an optical probe
        based on discrete rotational symmetric triangulation is proposed in this paper.
        The emitting laser beam of the probe is the rotational axis and the five receiving
        optical paths (lenses and mirrors) are rotationally symmetrically distributed
        around the laser axis and are coimaged on a CMOS camera. Results of simulations
        and experiments show that the new-established prototype is designed with good
        robustness under various conditions such as different surface characteristics
        and different inclination degrees. The probe enables conducting real-time
        on-machine measurement without directional dependency with a resolution of

        secretory function of airway epithelial cells is important in the pathogenesis

        of NKILA (nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) interacting long noncoding RNA
        (lncRNA)) in MPP, we first detected NKILA as well as the concentration of
        interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in bronchoalveolar
        lavage fluid of children with MPP. Then, NKILA was knocked down in epithelial
        cells to investigate its effect on their secretory function. The results suggested
        that NKILA was downregulated in children with MPP, while IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1
        levels increased. Knockdown of NKILA in vitro promoted the inflammatory effects
        of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) in epithelial A549 and BEAS-2B cells. Knockdown
        of NKILA promoted inhibitor of \u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) phosphorylation
        and degradation, and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, RNA
        immunoprecipitation showed that NKILA could physically bind to I\u03baB\u03b1
        in MP-treated A549 cells. Collectively, our data demonstrated that attenuation

        new flexible microwave tag system using a frequency-scanning type RFID is
        proposed with multiple resonators based on defected ground structures (DGSs).
        The proposed system achieves fully passive tag systems using multiple resonators
        with a spiral-shaped DGS over a wide frequency range. The resonator implemented
        on the rear side of a transmission line has the advantages of excellent band
        notch characteristics as well as bit-error avoidance from the frequency selective
        reflection. In addition, the tag system is designed on a thin flexible substrate
        in order to be applicable for amorphous surfaces. The proposed microwave tags
        have been implemented with wideband antennas at 3\u20137\u2009GHz on thick
        and thin flexible substrates. The flexibility of the thin substrate has been
        evaluated in terms of cognitive capability for various radiuses of curvatures.
        From the experimental results in an anechoic chamber, the excellent recognition
        of various multibits identification codes in a wireless transmission environment
        has been verified.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2013\/415607","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,4]],"date-time":"2013-06-04T21:03:06Z","timestamp":1370379786000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Flexible

        life adversity increases the risk of mental disorders later in life. Chronic
        early life stress may alter neurotrophic factor gene expression including
        those for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell derived
        neurotrophic factor (GDNF) that are important in neuronal growth, survival,
        and maintenance. Maternal separation was used in this study to model early
        life stress. Following unilateral injection of a mild dose of 6-hydroxydopamine
        (6-OHDA), we measured corticosterone (CORT) in the blood and striatum of stressed
        and nonstressed rats; we also measured DNA methylation and BDNF and GDNF gene
        expression in the striatum using real time PCR. In the presence of stress,
        we found that there was increased corticosterone concentration in both blood
        and striatal tissue. Further to this, we found higher DNA methylation and
        decreased neurotrophic factor gene expression. 6-OHDA lesion increased neurotrophic
        factor gene expression in both stressed and nonstressed rats but this increase
        was higher in the nonstressed rats. Our results suggest that exposure to early
        postnatal stress increases corticosterone concentration which leads to increased
        DNA methylation. This effect results in decreased BDNF and GDNF gene expression
        in the striatum leading to decreased protection against subsequent insults

        Clear cell basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an uncommon and unusual variant of
        BCC, which is characterized by a variable component of clear cells. The pathogenesis
        of this histological variant and its clinical significance has not been clarified.  Differentiation
        of this uncommon variant of BCC from other clear cell tumors is important
        for the treatment. \n<jats:italic>Case Presentation<\/jats:italic>. A 65-year-old
        male presented with a 0.9\u2009cm dome-shaped lesion on his upper chest.  A
        shave biopsy revealed a dermal basaloid tumor that comprised nests with a
        peripheral palisading pattern, retraction artifacts, and striking clear cell
        changes.  Histopathologic examination, along with findings from immunohistochemical
        studies and special staining of the clear cells, supports the diagnosis of
        clear cell basal cell carcinoma. \n<jats:italic>Conclusion<\/jats:italic>.
        Clear cell BCC is a rare and unusual variant of BCC.  The underlying pathogenesis

        disease animal models are absolutely invaluable tools for our understanding
        of mechanisms involved in both physiological and pathological processes. By
        studying various genetic abnormalities in these organisms we can get a better
        insight into potential candidate genes responsible for human disease development.
        To this point a mouse represents one of the most used and convenient species
        for human disease modeling. Hundreds if not thousands of inbred, congenic,
        and transgenic mouse models have been created and are now extensively utilized
        in the research labs worldwide. Importantly, pluripotent stem cells play a
        significant role in developing new genetically engineered mice with the desired
        human disease-like phenotype. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells which represent
        reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells represent a significant

        disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of childhood with prolonged fever,
        and the diagnosis of KD is mainly based on clinical criteria, which is prone
        to misdiagnosis with other febrile infectious (FI) diseases. Currently, there
        remain no effective molecular markers for KD diagnosis. In this study, we
        aimed to use a relative-expression-based method k-TSP and resampling framework
        to identify robust gene pair signatures to distinguish KD from bacterial and
        virus febrile infectious diseases. Our study pool consisted of 808 childhood
        patients from several studies and assigned to three groups, namely, the discovery
        set (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>=<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>224<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>),
        validation set-1 (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M2\"><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>=<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>197<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>),
        and validation set-2 (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M3\"><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>=<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>387<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>).
        We had identified 60 biologically relevant gene pairs and developed a top-ranked
        gene pair classifier (TRGP) using the first seven signatures, with the area
        under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUROC) of 0.947 (95% CI,
        0.918-0.976), a sensitivity of 0.936 (95% CI, 0.872-0.987), and a specificity
        of 0.774 (95% CI, 0.705-0.836) in the discovery set. In the validation set-1,
        the TRGP classifier distinguished KD from FI with AUROC of 0.955 (95% CI,
        0.919-0.991), a sensitivity of 0.959 (95% CI, 0.925-0.986), and a specificity
        of 0.863 (95% CI, 0.764-0.961). In the validation set-2, the predictive performance
        of classification was with an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.747-0.845), a sensitivity
        of 0.797 (95% CI, 0.720-0.864), and a specificity of 0.661 (95% CI, 0.606-0.717).
        Our study reveals that gene pair signatures are robust across diverse studies
        and can be utilized as objective biomarkers to distinguish KD from FI, helping
        to develop a fast, simple, and effective molecular approach to improve the
        diagnosis of KD.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/6539398","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]],"date-time":"2020-04-27T23:36:21Z","timestamp":1588030581000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Distinguishing

        to its openness and simplicity, Modbus TCP has wide applications to facilitate
        the actual management and control in industrial wireless fields. However,
        its potential security vulnerabilities can also create lots of complicated
        information security challenges, which are increasingly threatening the availability
        of industrial real-time traffic delivery. Although anomaly detection has been
        recognized as a workable security measure to identify attacks, the critical
        step to successfully extract data characteristics is an extremely difficult
        task. In this paper, we focus on the continuous control mode in industrial
        processes and propose a control tracing feature algorithm to extract the function-driven
        tracing characteristics from Modbus TCP data traffic. Furthermore, this algorithm
        can flexibly integrate the time factor with critical functional operations
        and adequately describe the dynamic control change of technological processes.
        To closely cooperate with this algorithm, one optimized SVM (support vector
        machine) classifier is introduced as the practicable decision engine. By designing
        one applicable attack mode, we develop an in-depth and meticulous analysis
        on the decision accuracy, and all experimental results clearly explain that
        the extracted features can strongly reflect the changing pattern of continuous
        functional operations, and the proposed algorithm can effectively cooperate
        with the optimized SVM classifier to distinguish abnormal Modbus TCP data
        traffic.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6839179","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,26]],"date-time":"2021-12-26T19:50:12Z","timestamp":1640548212000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Extracting

        is well known that coalmine gas concentration forecasting is very significant
        to ensure the safety of mining. Owing to the high-frequency, nonstationary
        fluctuations and chaotic properties of the gas concentration time series,
        a gas concentration forecasting model utilizing the original raw data often
        leads to an inability to provide satisfying forecast results. A hybrid forecasting
        model that integrates wavelet transform and extreme learning machine (ELM)
        termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) for coalmine gas concentration is proposed.
        Firstly, the proposed model employs Mallat algorithm to decompose and reconstruct
        the gas concentration time series to isolate the low-frequency and high-frequency
        information. Then, ELM model is built for the prediction of each component.
        At last, these predicted values are superimposed to obtain the predicted values
        of the original sequence. This method makes an effective separation of the
        feature information of gas concentration time series and takes full advantage
        of multi-ELM prediction models with different parameters to achieve divide
        and rule. Comparative studies with existing prediction models indicate that
        the proposed model is very promising and can be implemented in one-step or
        multistep ahead prediction.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/858260","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,23]],"date-time":"2014-07-23T18:26:57Z","timestamp":1406140017000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Short-Term

        is mainly used to determine the distinguishable samples and subsample; the
        second layer is a nonlinear discriminant model, which is used to determine
        the subsample type. Numerical experiments on real data sets show that this

        broadcast is an effective data dissemination technique to enhance the system
        ability to handle dynamic client access patterns. With the development of
        real-time wireless applications, it is practical for clients to request multiple
        related data items with time constraint in one request. For real-time data
        broadcast, items are only useful if they can be received by clients before
        expiration; otherwise, the related requests become invalid. Hence, minimizing
        the number of requests that miss their deadlines becomes an important task
        in on-demand broadcast, especially for multi-item scenario, where more requests
        are inclined to miss their deadlines due to the heavier workload and greater
        complexity, compared with single-item scenario. In this paper, we propose
        a network coding-based scheduling algorithm for real-time multi-item data
        dissemination. The proposed algorithm exploits the coding opportunities between
        cached and requested data items and integrates network coding with data scheduling
        to minimize the deadline miss ratio. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
        that the proposed algorithm achieves the lowest deadline miss ratio under
        various circumstances. In addition, the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm
        in utilizing the transmission bandwidth is proved for that fewer instances
        of ineffective service are provided for satisfying clients\u2019 requests

Expression of nine candidate genes [<jats:italic>Actn2<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Actn3<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Casq1<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Drd2<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Lepr<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Mc4r<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Mstn<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Papss2<\/jats:italic>,

        transcript levels in the soleus were higher in the low-active mice. However,
        when these genes were evaluated in na\u00efve animals, differential expression
        was not observed, demonstrating a training effect. Among na\u00efve mice,
        no genes in either tissue exhibited differential expression between strains.
        Considering that no obvious SNP mechanisms were determined or differential
        expression was observed, our results indicate that genomic structural variation
        or gene expression data alone is not adequate to establish any of these genes\u2019

        study focuses on the problem that the multiobjective optimization decision-making
        process of the design scheme under the cloud service model fails to fully
        consider the needs of users\u2019 diversity, due to the lack of research on
        quantitative modeling and evaluation methods of designers\u2019 ability. It
        affects the reasonable matching between complex design tasks and design ability
        and hinders the socialized aggregation of design ability. Based on the competency
        model, facing the industrial designers in the cloud manufacturing model, our
        paper constructs the design capability evaluation system from the perspectives
        of Yuan Shengren capability, industry technology competency, design task competency,
        and learning capability competency and discusses the design capability evaluation
        method based on a network analysis method. Through the design capability evaluation
        of the industrial design cloud service platform, feasibility and scientificity
        of the method in this paper are verified. This paper proposes a design scheme
        optimization decision-making method combining quality function configuration
        and rough set theory. Based on the analysis of the cloud service model, this
        method introduces the design decision-making process model of user participation
        and fuzzy evaluation mechanism to carry out cluster analysis and the intelligent
        transformation of user requirements. A design scheme evaluation index system
        oriented to user requirements is established, and the importance of design
        scheme evaluation indexes in the process of networked collaborative design
        is accurately quantified. Following the principle of combining scientificity
        and systematicness, a third-order decision-making model for design scheme
        optimization under the cloud service model is proposed. The model is solved
        by combining the rough set theory and rough approximation ideal solution.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/7610040","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,27]],"date-time":"2022-02-27T22:20:07Z","timestamp":1646000407000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Industrial

        data mining has become an increasing concern in the location-based applications,
        and the trajectory partition is taken as the primary procedure of trajectory
        data mining. The amount of movement trajectories of nodes is typically very
        large, and the trajectory shapes are extremely diverse, which makes the trajectory
        partition a vital issue to the trajectory data mining results. In this work,
        the movement behaviors of nodes are analyzed from the aspects of moving speeds,
        stop points, and moving directions, and then a novel Trajectory Partition
        Method based on combined movement Features (TPMF) is proposed to partition
        the trajectories. In TPMF, we first extract the change points where the movement
        speeds of nodes are varied significantly; then, we extract the stop points
        by detecting the speed variations of nodes; finally, the Douglas-Peucker algorithm
        is applied to partition the subtrajectories according to the extracted feature
        points (change points and stop points). Simulations are carried out on the<jats:italic>
        Geolife<\/jats:italic> trajectory dataset, and the simulation results indicate
        that TPMF can achieve a preferable trade-off between the simplification rate
        and the trajectory partition error, while the running time is shortened as
        well.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/7803293","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,24]],"date-time":"2019-07-24T23:31:09Z","timestamp":1564011069000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["A

        information entropy, and acoustic emission damage as precursor discrimination
        indicators for the occurrence of rock explosion. Study of the impact of the

        when the rock rupture acoustic emission RA value time is the earliest. The
        remaining four precursor discrimination indicators of rock rupture with different

        control of breast cancer is the shared domain and responsibility of surgeons
        and radiation oncologists. Because surgeons are often the first providers
        to discuss locoregional control and recurrence risks with patients and because
        they serve in a key gatekeeping role as referring providers for radiation
        therapy, a sophisticated understanding of the evidence regarding radiotherapy
        in breast cancer management is essential for the practicing surgeon. This
        paper synthesizes the complex and evolving evidence regarding the role of
        radiation therapy after mastectomy. Although substantial evidence indicates
        that radiation therapy can reduce the risk of locoregional failure after mastectomy
        (with a relative reduction of risk of approximately two-thirds), debate persists
        regarding the specific subgroups who have sufficient risks of residual microscopic
        locoregional disease after mastectomy to warrant treatment with radiation.
        This paper reviews the evidence available to guide appropriate referral and
        patient decision making, with special attention to areas of controversy, including
        patients with limited nodal disease, those with large tumors but negative
        nodes, node-negative patients with high risk features, patients who have received
        systemic chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, and patients who may wish

        COQ2 mutations have been reported in Japanese multiple system atrophy (MSA)

        with dementia, 466 patients with ET, and 1038 healthy controls, were included.
        Genotyping for the COQ2 V393A (T&gt;C) was carried out. Odds ratio (OR) adjusted
        by age and gender, together with 95% confidence interval (CI), was reported
        by means of logistic regression.<jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>. The frequency
        of the polymorphic variant V393A heterozygous (T\/C) was 2.7% in dementia,
        1.1% in ET, and 2.5% in controls (OR = 0.70, 95% confidence interval is 0.29\u20131.72

        laying cables are often used at inlet and outlet regions of a power distribution
        cabinet. In order to improve the heat transfer performance and extend service
        life of a trench laying cable, the heat transfer and cable ampacity of the
        trench laying cable with a ceramic plate were numerically studied in the present
        paper and the results were compared with those of a traditional trench laying
        cable. The variations of conductor loss and eddy current loss of different
        loop cables were discussed in the trench with a ceramic plate, and the effects
        of ceramic plate parameters on heat transfer performance of the trench laying
        cable were optimized using the Taguchi method. It is found that for the trench
        with ceramic plates, although the ceramic plate restrains the natural convection
        in the trench, the total heat transfer for natural convection and thermal
        radiation are enhanced for the cables and the cable ampacity can be improved.
        The difference of electromagnetic loss between the upper- and lower-layer
        cables in the trench with ceramic plate is quite small. When the cable core
        current (I) increases from 700\u2009A to 1100\u2009A, the maximum difference
        of averaged electromagnetic loss between the upper- and lower-layer cables
        is 1.22%. With the Taguchi method, an optimum parameter combination is obtained.
        When the length, thickness, and surface emissivity of the ceramic plate are
        equal to 0.48\u2009m, 0.0734\u2009m, and 0.8, respectively, at I\u2009=\u2009900\u2009A,
        the cable maximum temperature in the trench is the lowest.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1227817","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]],"date-time":"2021-09-09T18:51:48Z","timestamp":1631213508000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Numerical

        the past two decades, a number of studies have failed to provide direct evidence
        of specific microbial chronic infection in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
        However, a recent report suggests that there is a specific association of<jats:italic>Chlamydia
        pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>in patients with PBC and that<jats:italic>C. pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>or
        similar antigens might play a role in the pathogenesis of disease. To determine
        if<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>infection is associated with PBC, we
        applied a combination of immunological and molecular approaches to investigate
        (a) the serological reactivity against two common<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>human
        pathogens,<jats:italic>C. pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>C. trachomatis<\/jats:italic>,
        by immunoblotting, (b) the presence of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>in
        liver samples of patients with PBC and controls by PCR amplification of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>specific
        16S rRNA and (c) the presence of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>proteins
        in liver samples of patients with PBC and controls by immunohistochemical
        staining. By immunoblotting,<jats:italic>C. trachomatis<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>C.
        pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>specific serological antibodies were found in 52\/57
        (91.2%) AMA positive PBC, 7\/33 (21\/2%) of AMA negative PBC, 1\/25 (4%) PSC,
        0\/15 (0%) Sjorgen''s syndrome and 0\/20 (0%) systemic lupus erythematosus
        patients and 0\/20 (0%) healthy volunteers at 1:200 sera dilution. PBC sera
        reacted to<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>E. coli<\/jats:italic>lysates
        in western blots up to a maximum of 10<jats:sup>-4<\/jats:sup>dilution. However,
        PCR amplification of the<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>specific 16S
        rRNA gene was negative in 25\/25 PBC livers but positive in 1\/4 PSC liver,
        3\/6 in other liver disease controls and 1\/4 normal liver samples. While
        two commercially available specific monoclonal antibodies stained positive
        controls (<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>infected HEp-2 cells) they
        failed to detect<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>antigens in PBC livers.
        The detection of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>specific antibodies but
        not<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>rRNA gene and<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>antigens

        We describe the clinical manifestations of supra-large range nonperfusion
        area (SLRNPA) in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods. This was a retrospective
        case-control study. A total of 260 eyes of 236 patients with DR who underwent
        pars plana vitrectomy in the Department of Ophthalmology of Qingdao Municipal
        Hospital from February 2016 to June 2019 were enrolled. Fundus fluorescein
        angiography was performed after surgery to determine whether SLRNPA or non-SLRNPA
        in DR was present. All demographic and clinical data were carefully collected.
        Results. Forty-one eyes of 22 patients were diagnosed with SLRNPA in DR (15.77%
        of all eyes). Compared to non-SLRNPA, SLRNPA patients were more likely to
        be male and younger with earlier DR onset, a smoking history, other comorbidities,
        and a higher HbA1c level. SLRNPA in DR eyes exhibited more neovascular glaucoma
        (NVG) and diabetic keratopathy (DK) than did other eyes. Such eyes were more
        likely to require anti-VEGF therapy before surgery or a silicone oil or a
        gas tamponade during surgery and to suffer from persistent corneal epithelial
        erosion and NVG recurrence after surgery. Conclusions. SLRNPA in DR is a severe
        status of DR. Treatment for DR patients with SLRNPA is difficult, and the
        prognosis is poor, so clinicians must thus pay more attention to SLRNPA in
        DR.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/8775641","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]],"date-time":"2022-02-04T03:06:07Z","timestamp":1643943967000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Clinical

        use of magnetorheological dampers has rapidly spread to many engineering applications,
        especially those related to transportation and civil engineering. The problem
        arises upon modelling their highly nonlinear behaviour: in spite of the huge
        number of apparently accurate models in the literature, most fail when considering
        the overall magnetomechanical behaviour. In this study, a brief but broad
        review of different magnetorheological damper models has been carried out,
        which includes characterisation, modelling, and comparison. Unlike many other
        studies, the analyses cover the behaviour from preyield to postyield regions
        of the MR fluid. The performance of the different models has been assessed
        by means of numerous experimental tests and by means of simulations in a simple
        and straightforward semiactive control case study. The results obtained prove
        that most models usually fail in predicting accurate low-velocity behaviour
        (before iron chains yield) and, as a result, may lead to bad estimations when
        used in control schemes due to modelling errors and chattering.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/5636053","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]],"date-time":"2019-05-02T23:35:25Z","timestamp":1556840125000},"page":"1-23","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Modelling

        order to explore marine natural resources using remote robotic sensor or to
        enable rapid information exchange between ROV (remotely operated vehicles),
        AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle), divers, and ships, ultrasonic underwater
        communication systems are used. However, if the communication system is applied
        to rich living creature marine environment such as shallow sea, it suffers
        from generated Impulsive Noise so-called Shrimp Noise, which is randomly generated
        in time domain and seriously degrades communication performance in underwater
        acoustic network. With the purpose of supporting high performance underwater
        communication, a robust digital communication method for Impulsive Noise environments
        is necessary. In this paper, we propose OFDM ultrasonic communication system
        with diversity receiver. The main feature of the receiver is a newly proposed
        Frequency Domain Diversity Combined Impulsive Noise Canceller. The OFDM receiver
        utilizes 20\u201328\u2009KHz ultrasonic channel and subcarrier spacing of
        46.875\u2009Hz (MODE3) and 93.750\u2009Hz (MODE2) OFDM modulations. In addition,
        the paper shows Impulsive Noise distribution data measured at a fishing port
        in Okinawa and at a barge in Shizuoka prefectures and then proposed diversity
        OFDM transceivers architecture and experimental results are described. By
        the proposed Impulsive Noise Canceller, frame bit error rate has been decreased

        versatile potentiometer that works with electrode arrays in flow injection
        and\/or monosegmented flow systems is described. The potentiometer is controlled
        by a microcomputer that allows individual, sequential multiplexed or random
        accesses to eight electrodes while employing only one reference electrode.
        The instrument was demonstrated by monitoring an array of seven flow-through
        ion-selective electrodes for Ag<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>and for three electrodes
        for Cl<jats:sup>-<\/jats:sup>, Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>and K<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>.
        The figures of merit of the individual and multiplexed (summed) readings of
        the electrode array were compared. The absolute standard deviation of the
        measurements made by summing the potential of two or more electrodes was maintained
        constant, thus improving the precision of the measurements. This result shows
        that an attempt to combine the signals of the electrodes to produce a more
        intense signal in the Hadamard strategy is feasible and accompanied by a proportional
        improvement in the precision of individual measurements. The preliminary tests
        suggest that the system can allow for 270 determinations per hour, with a

        intelligent information system constructed by the sensor web can monitor all
        kinds of sudden abnormal events, improve the ability of event discovery and
        rapid disposal, and promote the development of smart city and the construction
        of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider the problem of
        complex integration and poor expansibility in the large-scale full-network
        operation and maintenance system construction and propose an active and passive
        event service (APES) method based on the sensor web. In the APES, a system
        framework with the perception layer, data service layer, event service layer,
        and user layer is firstly defined and constructed. Secondly, a middleware
        with the ability to active and passive event service (APES) is designed and
        implemented based on the system framework. Finally, taking abnormal weather
        and fire warning as examples, the performance of the proposed event service
        middleware is tested, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed
        APES model in this paper has the advantages of high precision, stable operation,
        and strong practicability and solves \u201cInformation Island\u201d and low
        reusability in the whole network operation and maintenance system. This is
        an attempt at the structural design of a similar intelligent information system.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/2578744","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]],"date-time":"2022-02-01T00:50:09Z","timestamp":1643676609000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

        with the common marine renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and wave
        energy, etc., the hydraulic pressure stored in the deep seawater can output
        stable and successive energy flow. Thus, it can be directly coupled with the
        reverse osmosis (RO) process to supply drinkable mineral water for crews of
        Deep Sea Space Station (DSSS). We proposed a novel submarine RO desalination
        system driven by the hydraulic pressure of deep seawater (SHP-RO), composed
        of a desalination branch to generate fresh water and a back pressure branch
        to ensure the depth independence of the desalination. The influences of the
        deep sea environment on the RO were analyzed, based on which the pretreatment
        of the seawater and the preparation of the drinkable mineral water were studied.
        The turbine-based energy recovery scheme was investigated in virtue of the
        CFD simulation on the flow behavior in the different turbine series. It was
        predicted that, when the DSSS was located at the depth of 1100\u2009m and
        the operating pressure of the RO process was 6.0\u2009MPa, for a drinkable
        water production rate of 240\u2009m3\/d, the recovered hydraulic pressure
        energy can achieve 39.22\u2009kW\u00b7h, which was enough for driving electricity

        Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading liver cancer with special immune
        microenvironment, which played vital roles in tumor relapse and poor drug
        responses. In this study, we aimed to explore the prognostic immune signatures
        in HCC and tried to construct an immune-risk model for patient evaluation.
        Methods. RNA sequencing profiles of HCC patients were collected from the cancer
        genome Atlas (TCGA), international cancer genome consortium (ICGC), and gene
        expression omnibus (GEO) databases (GSE14520). Differentially expressed immune
        genes, derived from ImmPort database and MSigDB signaling pathway lists, between
        tumor and normal tissues were analyzed with Limma package in R environment.
        Univariate Cox regression was performed to find survival-related immune genes
        in TCGA dataset, and in further random forest algorithm analysis, significantly
        changed immune genes were used to generate a multivariate Cox model to calculate
        the corresponding immune-risk score. The model was examined in the other two
        datasets with recipient operation curve (ROC) and survival analysis. Risk
        effects of immune-risk score and clinical characteristics of patients were
        individually evaluated, and significant factors were then used to generate
        a nomogram. Results. There were 52 downregulated and 259 upregulated immune
        genes between tumor and relatively normal tissues, and the final immune-risk
        model (based on SPP1, BRD8, NDRG1, KITLG, HSPA4, TRAF3, ITGAV and MAP4K2)
        can better differentiate patients into high and low immune-risk subpopulations,
        in which high score patients showed worse outcomes after resection (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math
        xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <mi>p<\/mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;<\/mo>\n                        <mn>0.05<\/mn>\n                     <\/math>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula>).
        The differentially enriched pathways between the two groups were mainly about
        cell proliferation and cytokine production, and calculated immune-risk score
        was also highly correlated with immune infiltration levels. The nomogram,
        constructed with immune-risk score and tumor stages, showed high accuracy
        and clinical benefits in prediction of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival,
        which is useful in clinical practice. Conclusion. The immune-risk model, based
        on expression of SPP1, BRD8, NDRG1, KITLG, HSPA4, TRAF3, ITGAV, and MAP4K2,
        can better differentiate patients into high and low immune-risk groups. Combined
        nomogram, using immune-risk score and tumor stages, could make accurate prediction
        of 1-, 3- and 5-year survival in HCC patients.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6676537","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,18]],"date-time":"2021-03-18T19:35:06Z","timestamp":1616096106000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Machine

        merchants enter hybrid e-commerce platforms (such as JD.com and Amazon), they
        will face issues such as which sales methods to choose and whether to use
        platform logistics under different power structures. Different sales methods
        and logistics service strategies have resulted in three operating modes: (a)
        resale mode, marked as A, (b) agency\u2009+\u2009no-platform logistics, marked
        as B, and (c) agency\u2009+\u2009platform logistics, marked as C. This paper
        constructs an analysis framework composed of an e-commerce platform and a
        merchant to explore the optimal operating mode. The game models of the three
        modes are first constructed, and then, the equilibrium results are compared
        and analysed. Based on the results of comparative analysis and considering
        the dynamic game between the e-commerce platform and the merchant regarding
        sales methods and logistics service strategies, the optimal operating mode
        is determined. The results show that when the platform has absolute power,
        mode C is optimal for it. When the logistics service sensitivity coefficient
        and market size are both large, the best for the merchant with absolute power
        is mode B. In addition, if neither of them has absolute power, only when the
        merchant first decides the logistics service strategy, then the platform decides
        the sales method; the best for both parties is mode B; otherwise, the best
        is mode A. This research has generated new insights and has practical management
        significance, which can provide guidance for merchant and platform decision-making.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/7653068","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]],"date-time":"2021-12-15T02:05:08Z","timestamp":1639533908000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Considering

        The local memory has to be used by applications that access data randomly.
        A typical case belonging to this category is image registration. On the other
        hand, an application such as edge detection can directly read data through
        the interconnect in a sequential fashion. Two different algorithms of image
        registration, the exhaustive search algorithm and the Discrete Wavelet Transform
        (DWT)-based search algorithm, are implemented on hardware, i.e., Xilinx Vertex-IIPro

        air traffic flow management (ATFM) is an effective way to alleviate demand-capacity
        imbalances globally and thereafter reduce airspace congestion and flight delays.
        The conventional ATFM models assume the capacities of airports or airspace
        sectors are all predetermined. However, the capacity uncertainties due to
        the dynamics of convective weather may make the deterministic ATFM measures
        impractical. This paper investigates the stochastic air traffic network flow
        optimization (SATNFO) problem, which is formulated as a weighted biobjective
        0-1 integer programming model. In order to evaluate the effect of capacity
        uncertainties on ATFM, the operational risk is modeled via probabilistic risk
        assessment and introduced as an extra objective in SATNFO problem. Computation
        experiments using real-world air traffic network data associated with simulated
        weather data show that presented model has far less constraints compared to
        stochastic model with nonanticipative constraints, which means our proposed
        model reduces the computation complexity.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/742541","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,10]],"date-time":"2015-06-10T20:22:22Z","timestamp":1433967742000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["A

        people activity recognition has become a vital necessity in many countries,
        because most of the elderly people live alone and are vulnerable. Thus, more
        research to advance in the monitoring systems used to recognize the activities
        of elderly people is required. Many researchers have proposed different monitoring
        systems for activity recognition using wired and wireless wearable sensing
        devices. However, the activity classification accuracy achieved so far should
        be improved to meet the challenges of more precise activity monitoring. Our
        study proposes a smart Human Activity Recognition system architecture utilizing
        an open source dataset generated by wireless, batteryless sensors used by
        14 healthy aged persons and unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms.
        In this paper, we also propose using a smart grid for checking regularly the
        wearable sensing device operational status to address the well-known reliability
        challenges of these devices, such as wireless charging and data trustworthiness.
        As the data from the sensing device is very noisy, we employ the K-means++
        clustering to identify outliers and use advanced ensemble classification techniques,
        such as the stacking classifier for which a meta model built using the random
        forest algorithm gave better results than all other base models considered.
        We also employ a bagging classifier, which is an ensemble meta-estimator fitting
        the prediction outputs of the base classifiers and aggregating them to produce
        the ensemble output. The best classification accuracy of 99.81 was achieved
        by the stacking classifier in training and 99.78% in testing, respectively.
        Comparisons for finding the best model were conducted using the recall, F1
        score, and precision values.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/9540033","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,23]],"date-time":"2022-03-23T01:20:06Z","timestamp":1647998406000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Elderly

        paper focused on choosing the best design of subsurface land drainage systems
        in semiarid areas. The study presented three different soil layers with different
        hydraulic conductivity and permeability, all layers are below the drain level,
        and the permeability is increasing with depth. A mathematical model was formulated
        for the horizontal and vertical drainage optimal design. The result was a
        nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear constraints, which required
        numerical methods for its solution. The purpose of the mathematical model
        is to find the best values of pipes and tubewells spacing, groundwater table
        drawdown, and pumps operating hours which leads to a minimum total cost of
        the subsurface drainage design. A computer code was developed in MATLAB environment
        and applied to the case study. Results show that the vertical drainage was
        economically better for the case study drainage network design. And the main
        factor affecting the mathematical model for both pipe and well drainage was
        the distance between pipes and tubewells. In addition, considering the lifespan
        of vertical drainage project, the optimal design involves the minimum possible
        duration of pumping stations. It is hoped that the proposed optimal mathematical
        model will present a design methodology by which the costs of all alternative
        designs can be compared so that the least-cost design is selected.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8827300","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,16]],"date-time":"2021-06-16T19:05:08Z","timestamp":1623870308000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        a real world application, we seldom get all images at one time. Considering
        this case, if a company hired an employee, all his images information needs
        to be recorded into the system; if we rerun the face recognition algorithm,
        it will be time consuming. To address this problem, In this paper, firstly,
        we proposed a novel subspace incremental method called incremental graph regularized
        nonnegative matrix factorization (IGNMF) algorithm which imposes manifold
        into incremental nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (INMF); thus,
        our new algorithm is able to preserve the geometric structure in the data
        under incremental study framework; secondly, considering we always get many
        face images belonging to one person or many different people as a batch, we
        improved our IGNMF algorithms to Batch-IGNMF algorithms (B-IGNMF), which implements
        incremental study in batches. Experiments show that (1) the recognition rate
        of our IGNMF and B-IGNMF algorithms is close to GNMF algorithm while it runs
        faster than GNMF. (2) The running times of our IGNMF and B-IGNMF algorithms
        are close to INMF while the recognition rate outperforms INMF. (3) Comparing
        with other popular NMF-based face recognition incremental algorithms, our
        IGNMF and B-IGNMF also outperform then both the recognition rate and the running
        time.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/928051","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,19]],"date-time":"2014-05-19T17:27:48Z","timestamp":1400520468000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Incremental

        and Aim. With regard to patients with intermediate-stage, irresectable hepatocellular
        carcinoma (HCC), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the mainstay
        of treatment. There is an urgent clinical requirement to identify reliable
        biomarkers to predict the response of HCC patients to TACE treatment. We aimed
        to identify a gene signature for predicting TACE response in HCC patients
        based on bioinformatics analysis. Methods. We downloaded the gene expression
        profile GSE104580 based on 147 tumor samples from 81 responders to TACE and
        66 nonresponders from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we
        randomly divided the 147 tumor samples into a training set (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        and a validation set (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        and screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the training set. Gene
        Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
        enrichment analyses were performed to annotate functions of the DEGs. The
        DEGs were mapped into the STRING website for constructing protein-protein
        interaction (PPI). The predictive value of the candidate genes by receiver-operating
        characteristic (ROC) curves was further verified in the validation set. Results.
        We totally found 158 DEGs (92 upregulated genes and 66 downregulated genes)
        in the training set. The GO enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were significantly
        enriched in metabolic and catabolic processes, such as drug metabolic process,
        fatty acid metabolic process, and small molecule catabolic process. The KEGG
        pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in drug metabolism-cytochrome
        P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, and chemical carcinogenesis.
        We identified 6 candidate genes (CXCL8, AFP, CYP1A1, MMP9, CYP3A4, and SERPINC1)
        based on the PPI network of the DEGs, which had high predictive value in HCC
        response to TACE with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.875 and 0.897
        for the training set and validation set, respectively. Conclusion. We identified
        a six-gene signature which might be biomarkers for predicting HCC response
        to TACE by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. However, the actual functions
        of these genes required verification.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3249816","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T22:50:08Z","timestamp":1626475808000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Identifying

        permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is part of production scheduling,
        which belongs to the hardest combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper,
        a multipopulation particle swarm optimization (PSO) based memetic algorithm
        (MPSOMA) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, the whole particle
        swarm population is divided into three subpopulations in which each particle
        evolves itself by the standard PSO and then updates each subpopulation by
        using different local search schemes such as variable neighborhood search
        (VNS) and individual improvement scheme (IIS). Then, the best particle of
        each subpopulation is selected to construct a probabilistic model by using
        estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and three particles are sampled
        from the probabilistic model to update the worst individual in each subpopulation.
        The best particle in the entire particle swarm is used to update the global
        optimal solution. The proposed MPSOMA is compared with two recently proposed
        algorithms, namely, PSO based memetic algorithm (PSOMA) and hybrid particle
        swarm optimization with estimation of distribution algorithm (PSOEDA), on
        29 well-known PFFSPs taken from OR-library, and the experimental results show

        the overhauling of the internal combustion engine, a lot of tools are used
        and among them is the poppet valve spring compressor. In Ghana, auto mechanics
        at the \u201cway-side\u201d garages make use of improvised tools, such as
        pipes, pliers, and push rods, for compressing valve springs. However, there
        are some challenges associated with the usage of these tools which include
        misplacement of cotters, injuries, and sometimes valve bends. In this work,
        a review of some of the existing designs of the improvised tools was considered.
        Also, a survey was conducted to seek the opinion of users (auto technicians
        and\/or mechanics) of the tools. A design was made for spring compression
        by incorporating a magnet with a pull force of 679.78\u2009N to take care
        of the removal of cotters during valve assembly dismantling. In this research,
        an efficient and user-friendly poppet valve spring compression tool with a
        total mass of 0.88\u2009kg was designed. Finite element analysis (FEA) was
        performed on the upper and lower parts of the tool to examine its response
        due to the loads that act on it during operation. It was discovered from the
        analysis that the upper frame of the valve spring compressor experienced the
        highest von Mises stress of 59.77\u2009MPa at the neck region, whilst the
        corresponding fatigue analysis showed a maximum fatigue life of 8.355\u2009\u00d7\u200910<jats:sup>9<\/jats:sup>

        In the resultant complex heterostructures, Ag nanocrystals were mainly deposited
        on the surface of Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O, while Ag-Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O
        composites were anchored onto GO sheets. The resultant Ag-Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O\/GO
        nanocomposites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with 90% of methyl
        orange (MO) dye degradation efficiency after 60\u2009min of visible-light
        irradiation, which was much higher than that of either Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O
        or Ag-Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O. This study opens a new avenue to fabricate
        visible-light-responsive photocatalyst with high performance for environmental

        antigen-specific T cell function is limited by immune tolerance in the tumor
        microenvironment. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells upregulate PD-L1
        expression to promote T cell exhaustion by PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions and undergo
        mutations to avoid being targeted by tumor antigen-specific T cells. Thus,
        tumor cells escape the immune surveillance by causing immune tolerance. We
        reason that a chimeric molecule made of a PD-L1-specific antibody linked to
        a cleavable antigenic peptide can target the antigenic peptide to the tumor
        microenvironment, resulting in the blockade of the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway and
        killing tumor cells through the coating of antigenic peptide. Here, we have
        generated a therapeutic chimeric protein containing the PD-L1 single-chain
        variable fragment (scFv) linked to a cleavable model cytotoxic T lymphocyte
        (CTL) epitope: E7 CTL peptide. Our study demonstrated that our chimeric protein
        (named PDL1-scFv-Fc-RE7) can target PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and enable
        E7 presentation by releasing cleavable E7 CTL peptide to coat tumor cells,
        resulting in tumor clearance by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. The presentation
        of the E7 peptide by cancer cells can then render tumor cells susceptible
        to the killing of preexisting E7-specific CD8+ T cells and contribute to tumor
        clearance. Our finding suggests a synergistic approach to not only enhance
        antigen-specific tumor clearance but also bypass immune tolerance.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/9054569","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,4]],"date-time":"2022-01-04T23:50:18Z","timestamp":1641340218000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Control

        were started every five years in the period of 1960\u20132005, with the initial
        conditions taken from the assimilation runs. The decadal prediction experiment
        by FGOALS-s2 shows significant high predictive skills in the Indian Ocean,
        tropical western Pacific, and Atlantic, similar to the results of the CMIP5
        multimodel ensemble. The predictive skills in the Indian Ocean and tropical
        western Pacific are primarily attributed to the model response to the external
        radiative forcing associated with the change of atmospheric compositions.
        In contrast, the high skills in the Atlantic are attributed, at least partly,
        to the improvements in the prediction of the Atlantic multidecadal variability

        is quite clear that the ability to perceive taste sensations significantly
        affects food choice, which consequently affects health status in the long
        term. Gustatory dysfunction is a neglected symptom among the depressed patients
        and those under antidepressants therapy, although these patients are suspectable
        to oral problems, due to general self-negligence related to mental disease,
        fear of dental treatment, and side effects of varied medications utilized
        in psychiatry. This study is aimed at assessing gustatory thresholds (detection
        and recognition thresholds) among a sample of 30 depressed Egyptian adults
        under antidepressants therapy for at least 3 months or psychotherapy with
        age ranging from 20 to 50 years old, seeking the Psychiatric Clinic at the
        Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. These patients were distributed
        into three equal groups (tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin
        reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and psychotherapy) and were assessed for gustatory
        detection and recognition thresholds using the filter paper disc method through
        a scoring system. The participants were also divided into normal taste group
        in which both the detection and recognition scores were 1, while the scores
        from 2 till 5 were considered as hypogeusia group and the score of 6 was considered
        as dysgeusia group. The TCA group was statistically significant from the other
        2 groups in sweet detection thresholds (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        where it was more common among TCA (70%) than both SSRIs and the psychotherapy
        group (20%). Gustatory dysfunction was found to be mostly associated with
        TCA followed by SSRIs particularly for sweet taste thresholds. More attention
        has to be given to taste changes among these patients as oral health affects
        general health by causing considerable pain and by changing what people eat,
        their speech, and their quality of life and wellbeing. Proper awareness and
        evaluation of this problem will improve the quality of life for the depressed
        patients and avoid unnecessary treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov

        fusion energy gains close to 100 when irradiated with an appropriate heavy
        ion beam. To reach such performances, we found that a high-Z radiation shield
        was necessary to screen the DT fuel from the radiation coming from the surrounding
        hot material. As opacity of high-Z materials is only weakly density dependent,
        we considered targets with lead shields both at solid density and with a density
        equivalent to that of the contiguous external material. The behaviour of both
        kinds of targets has been studied by introducing a small spatial nonuniformity
        on the external surface of the lead shield. Targets with low-density shields
        have been tested with a beam intensity perturbation, too. Because density
        gradients are very sharp and ablation is practically absent, we have found
        these implosions to be Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. The evolution has been followed
        in the nonlinear regime because the full hydrodynamical-radiative model with
        a nonlinear heavy ion energy deposition and mesh correction was used.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0263034600006698","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,3,9]],"date-time":"2009-03-09T16:26:04Z","timestamp":1236615964000},"page":"447-459","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Rayleigh-Taylor

        nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely utilized as a novel drug carrier with promising
        future applications in biomedical therapies due to their distinct characteristics.
        In the present work, carboxylic acid-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes
        (f-SWCNTs) were used as the starting material to react with anticancer drug,
        BA to produce f-SWCNTs-BA conjugate via<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        capacity, physicochemical properties, surface morphology, drug releasing characteristics,
        and cytotoxicity evaluation. The results indicated that the drug loading capacity
        was determined to be around 20\u2009wt% and this value has been verified by
        thermogravimetric analysis. The binding of BA onto the surface of f-SWCNTs
        was confirmed by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Powder XRD analysis showed
        that the structure of the conjugate was unaffected by the loading of BA. The
        developed conjugate was found to release the drug in a controlled manner with
        a prolonged release property. According to the preliminary<jats:italic>in
        vitro<\/jats:italic>cytotoxicity studies, the conjugate was not toxic in a
        standard fibroblast cell line, and anticancer activity was significantly higher
        in A549 than HepG2 cell line. This study suggests that f-SWCNTs could be developed
        as an efficient drug carrier to conjugate drugs for pharmaceutical applications

        10 (<jats:italic>CAPN10<\/jats:italic>) variants have been associated with
        the genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the present case-control
        study, we analysed the distribution of SNP-19 insertion\/deletion (I\/D) polymorphism
        in a total of 607 samples (103 T2D cases and 102 healthy controls) from Brahmin;
        (100 T2D cases and 100 healthy controls) from Bania and (100 T2D cases and
        102 healthy controls) from Jat Sikh ethnic groups of the North-West Indian
        population. Increased frequency of I allele and II genotype was found in T2D
        in Brahmin ethnic group [<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7003,
        OR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00b783 (1\u00b743\u20135\u00b761 at 95% CI)]. Significant
        correlation between II genotype and body mass index (BMI) was also observed
        [<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7003, OR\u00a0=\u00a03\u00b731
        (1\u00b752\u20137\u00b720 at 95% CI)]. No association for the genotypes and
        alleles was seen in Banias and Jat Sikhs. Our data suggests that SNP-19 I\/D
        variation in the <jats:italic>CAPN10<\/jats:italic> gene is modulated by ethnicity
        and influences the susceptibility to T2D in the North-West Indian population.
        We also performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies to assess the validity
        of this association. Data from 13 case-control studies with 15\u00a0760 samples
        comprising of 8395 T2D cases and 7365 controls were finally analysed. Significant
        heterogeneity between individual studies was evident in dominant and codominant
        models. The results of present meta-analysis indicate an association of T2D
        with carriers of DD genotype of <jats:italic>CAPN10<\/jats:italic> I\/D polymorphism.
        However, further analyses on a larger sample size are required to establish
        a conclusive association in meta-analysis.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0016672313000207","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,15]],"date-time":"2014-01-15T13:45:01Z","timestamp":1389793501000},"page":"146-155","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Ethnic

        simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the simultaneous
        separation of the highly polar and weakly polar components of traditional
        Chinese medicines was developed via a strategic combination of isocratic and
        gradient elution methods. Liu-Shen-Wan and Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan were used
        as representative examples of traditional Chinese medicines. This is the first
        time that 6 components of varying degrees of polarity in Liu-Shen-Wan had
        been successfully resolved in a single chromatographic run using an ultraviolet-visible
        detector with a fixed wavelength of 296\u2009nm. In contrast to conventional
        gradient separation methods, this novel method offered a viable route for
        separation of the highly and weakly polar fractions simultaneously, thus greatly
        reducing the time and cost of analysis. This method therefore provides a more
        efficient way to determine the polar components present in traditional Chinese
        medicines. It would find potential application in drug screening, drug authentication,
        and product quality control.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/7569283","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,19]],"date-time":"2018-03-19T19:33:00Z","timestamp":1521487980000},"page":"1-6","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Strategic

        Data supporting hypofractionated preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for patients
        with extremity and trunk soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are currently limited to
        phase II single-institution studies. We sought to understand the type and
        thresholds of clinical evidence required for experts to adopt hypofractionated
        RT as a standard-of-care option for patients with STS. Methods. An electronic
        survey was distributed to multidisciplinary sarcoma experts. The survey queried
        whether data from a theoretical, multi-institutional, phase II study of 5-fraction
        preoperative RT could change practice. Using endpoints from RTOG 0630 as a
        reference, the survey also queried thresholds for acceptable local control,
        wound complication, and late toxicity for the study protocol to be accepted
        as a standard-of-care option. Responses were logged from 8\/27\/2020 to 9\/8\/2020
        and summarized graphically. Results. The survey response rate was 55.3% (47\/85).
        Local control is the most important clinical outcome for sarcoma specialists
        when evaluating whether an RT regimen should be considered standard of care.
        17% (8\/47) of providers require randomized phase III evidence to consider
        hypofractionated preoperative RT as a standard-of-care option, whereas 10.6%
        (5\/47) of providers already view this as a standard-of-care option. Of providers
        willing to change practice based on phase II data, most (78%, 29\/37) would
        accept local control rates equivalent to or less than those in RTOG 0630,
        as long as the rate was higher than 85%. However, 51.3% (19\/37) would require
        wound complication rates superior to those reported in RTOG 0630, and 46%
        (17\/37) of respondents would accept late toxicity rates inferior to RTOG
        0630. Conclusion. Consensus building is needed among clinicians regarding
        the type and threshold of evidence needed to evaluate hypofractionated RT
        as a standard-of-care option. A collaborative consortium-based approach may
        be the most pragmatic means for developing consensus protocols and pooling
        data to gradually introduce hypofractionated preoperative RT into routine
        practice.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3735874","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,27]],"date-time":"2021-10-27T00:20:07Z","timestamp":1635294007000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Evaluating

        long-range NoC link enables efficient implementation of network-on-chip topologies
        which inherently require high-performance long-distance point-to-point communication
        such as torus and fat-tree structures. In addition, the performance of other
        topologies, such as mesh, can be improved by using high-performance link between
        few selected remote nodes. We presented novel implementation of high-performance
        long-range NoC link based on multilevel current-mode signaling and delay-insensitive
        two-phase 1-of-4 encoding. Current-mode signaling reduces the communication
        latency of long wires significantly compared to voltage-mode signaling, making
        it possible to achieve high throughput without pipelining and\/or using repeaters.
        The performance of the proposed multilevel current-mode interconnect is analyzed
        and compared with two reference voltage mode interconnects. These two reference
        interconnects are designed using two-phase 1-of-4 encoded voltage-mode signaling,
        one with pipeline stages and the other using optimal repeater insertion. The
        proposed multilevel current-mode interconnect achieves higher throughput and
        lower latency than the two reference interconnects. Its throughput at 8 mm
        wire length is 1.222 GWord\/s which is 1.58 and 1.89 times higher than the
        pipelined and optimal repeater insertion interconnects, respectively. Furthermore,
        its power consumption is less than the optimal repeater insertion voltage-mode
        interconnect, at 10 mm wire length its power consumption is 0.75 mW while
        the reference repeater insertion interconnect is 1.066 mW. The effect of crosstalk
        is analyzed using four-bit parallel data transfer with the best-case and worst-case
        switching patterns and a transmission line model which has both capacitive
        coupling and inductive coupling.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2007\/46514","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,10]],"date-time":"2007-05-10T08:22:07Z","timestamp":1178785327000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":15,"title":["High-Performance

        springs of the volcanic zones are characterized for having high sulfur content
        in the form of sulphate and other ions resulting from chemical reactions.
        Sources with these types of elements are of great interest for the tourism
        and geothermal industry because of their highlighted properties which include
        therapeutic treatments, relaxation baths, agricultural applications, and preservation
        of flora and fauna among others. For these reasons, research oriented to carry
        out the characterization of these factors is of great importance to determine
        the availability of places with such characteristics. This work shows the
        characterization of 17 hot spring sources located in the Coconuco and San
        Juan sectors (Cauca, Colombia, South America). Water samples were taken in
        May 2017, and laboratory analyses were carried out by the Water Laboratory
        at Universidad Nacional de Colombia-Manizales, based on the Standard Methods
        (APHA-AWWA-WEF). Rock samples were taken in November 2017, and laboratory
        analyses were carried out by the GMAS<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> Laboratory (Bogot\u00e1,
        Colombia). The Piper, Stiff, and ternary (Giggenbach) diagrams were used for
        the classification of major ions. Mineralogy composition was determined through
        XRD and XRF. Results indicate that most sources are of the sulphated type
        according to the anions and of the calcium type according to the cations.
        In concordance with Giggenbach diagrams, most of the sources are immature
        waters and, despite their interaction with rocks, they have not achieved the
        equilibrium. Likewise, these sources are of heated vapor type and, considering
        that they consist of sulphated acid sources, it is not possible to evaluate
        the reservoir temperatures from Na\/K cations. The low Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>\/Mg<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>
        ratio in the sources indicates the lack of direct migration of fluids and
        the high content of Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup> and Mg<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>
        regarding Na<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> and K<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>, which suggests
        that fluids possibly are mixed with cold waters rich in Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>
        and Mg<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>. From the mineralogic characterization, it
        was observed that volcanic rocks are composed of cristobalite and albite with
        TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>, Fe<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>,

        Phakic Intraocular Lens (P-IOL) implantation is a safe, easy, predictable
        intervention designed to manage moderate to high refractive errors. Complications
        are relatively uncommon and include mainly cataract and intraocular pressure
        spikes. Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS) is a rather unusual sterile
        anterior segment inflammation after uneventful intraocular surgery, extremely
        rarely reported after P-IOL implantation. Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome (UZS) is
        also very rarely described after P-IOL. To date, to the best of the authors\u2019
        knowledge, no article has ever described the simultaneous occurrence of TASS
        and UZS in a patient after P-IOL implantation. Objective. In this article,
        the authors present the case of a female patient with moderate myopic astigmatism,
        who underwent sequential P-IOL implantation at two different facilities. The
        postoperative course of the first eye was uneventful, but she developed complications
        associated to the intervention in the second eye. Materials. The article describes
        the case of a young patient who underwent a sequential Phakic Intraocular
        Lens (P-IOL) implantation at two different institutions. The postoperative
        course of the first eye (left eye) was uneventful; however, the second eye
        (right eye) initially developed Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS). Although
        timely and correct management was instituted, upon resolution of TASS, the
        patient developed Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome, anterior subcapsular cataract,
        and significant endothelial damage in the same eye. Results. The patient was
        followed closely and managed accordingly; corneal edema and anterior segment
        inflammation of the right eye eventually resolved. Nevertheless, an anterior
        subcapsular cataract and a fixed dilated pupil remained; with normal intraocular
        pressure (IOP). Specular microscopy confirmed an endothelial cell loss in
        the TASS eye (right eye). Pupil size showed no reaction to repeated doses

        which resulted in a 20\/50 vision. Conclusions. TASS and UZS are both extremely
        rare complications after uneventful P-IOL implantation, with only a handful
        of cases having been reported of each of them. To date, this is the very first
        case where UZS ensued after and potentially as a consequence of TASS in a
        patient who had undergone P-IOL implantation. Although a direct causative
        element could not be pinpointed, the fact that the complication ensued after
        being operated in one surgical institution and not the other, could suggest
        some role of different sterilization and handling procedures, but no direct
        conclusion can be made on this case.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/1216578","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,4]],"date-time":"2020-11-04T19:35:11Z","timestamp":1604518511000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Unilateral

        To evaluate the vascular response after directional coronary atherectomy (DCA)
        for left main (LM) bifurcation lesion. Methods. This study was a retrospective,
        single-center study enrolling 31 patients who underwent stentless therapy
        using DCA followed by drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for LM bifurcation
        lesion. We compared intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) findings before and after
        DCA. Results. After DCA, the lumen and vessel areas significantly increased,
        whereas the plaque area (PA) and %PA were significantly reduced. When the
        lesions were divided into small vessel and large vessel groups using the median
        value of the vessel area, the maximum balloon pressure of the DCA catheter
        was greater in the large vessel group. Changes in the lumen and vessel areas
        were also significantly greater in the large vessel group. On the other hand,
        the changes in PA and %PA were similar between groups. Conclusions. The main
        vascular responses associated with lumen enlargement after DCA were plaque
        reduction and vessel expansion. Contribution of vessel expansion to lumen
        enlargement was larger than the effect of plaque reduction in large vessel
        lesions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5541843","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,14]],"date-time":"2021-12-14T22:05:08Z","timestamp":1639519508000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Vascular

        analysis is applied to quantitatively analyze the impact of different ambient

        machine translation is a natural language processing research direction that
        has important scientific research value and practical value in the current
        artificial intelligence boom. The variability of language, the limited ability
        to express semantic information, and the lack of parallel corpus resources
        all limit the usefulness and popularity of English machine translation in
        practical applications. The self-attention mechanism has received a lot of
        attention in English machine translation tasks because of its highly parallelizable
        computing ability, which reduces the model\u2019s training time and allows
        it to capture the semantic relevance of all words in the context. The efficiency
        of the self-attention mechanism, however, differs from that of recurrent neural
        networks because it ignores the position and structure information between
        context words. The English machine translation model based on the self-attention
        mechanism uses sine and cosine position coding to represent the absolute position
        information of words in order to enable the model to use position information
        between words. This method, on the other hand, can reflect relative distance
        but does not provide directionality. As a result, a new model of English machine
        translation is proposed, which is based on the logarithmic position representation
        method and the self-attention mechanism. This model retains the distance and
        directional information between words, as well as the efficiency of the self-attention
        mechanism. Experiments show that the nonstrict phrase extraction method can
        effectively extract phrase translation pairs from the n-best word alignment
        results and that the extraction constraint strategy can improve translation
        quality even further. Nonstrict phrase extraction methods and n-best alignment
        results can significantly improve the quality of translation translations
        when compared to traditional phrase extraction methods based on single alignment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/2601480","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,23]],"date-time":"2021-12-23T21:58:36Z","timestamp":1640296716000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["English

        supervision involves the analysis of situations and decision making, some
        of which include ethical perspectives. This research endeavoured to gain a
        better understanding of the nature of the ethical problems encountered by
        supervisors. We have interviewed fourteen supervisors in two disciplines:
        the natural sciences and the behavioural sciences. We have identified the
        ethical issues in light of five ethical principles, namely respect for autonomy,
        non maleficence, beneficence, justice, and fidelity. We have located the ethical
        issues within the supervisory activity in two locations: the dyadic supervisor-student
        relationship and the academic community. The study shows that supervisors
        encounter a plethora of ethical issues. Many of the supervisors were highly
        aware of the ethical challenges in supervision and actively worked to anticipate
        and prevent ethical problems. The supervisors described a number of sustainable
        solutions, but at the same time, ethical problems and malpractice were reported.
        This suggests that the complexities of ethics are not always evident to the
        actors themselves. We claim that in order to expose and scrutinize supervision
        practices, it is insufficient to analyse the ethical issues only on dyadic
        level. What appears to boil down to a dyadic relationship may in fact be indicative
        of the values, attitudes, norms, and practices of the community.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2012\/961505","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,7]],"date-time":"2012-08-07T13:43:27Z","timestamp":1344347007000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["The

        whole endocrinological aspect of PCa. During aging, metabolic syndrome, including
        diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, can be associated
        with a chronic, low-grade inflammation of the prostate and with changes in
        the sex steroid pathways. These factors may affect both the carcinogenesis
        processes and treatment outcomes of PCa. Any treatment for PCa can have a
        long-lasting negative impact on quality of life and sexual health, which should
        be assessed by validated self-reported questionnaires. In particular, sexual
        health, urinary continence, and bowel function can be worsened after prostatectomy,
        radiotherapy, or hormone treatment, mostly in the elderly population. In the
        present review we summarized the current knowledge on the role of hormones,
        metabolic features, and primary treatments for PCa on the quality of life
        and sexual health of elderly Pca survivors.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/470592","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,17]],"date-time":"2014-03-17T21:02:17Z","timestamp":1395090137000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Quality

        order to enable the micro-nanosatellites equipped with microthrusters to better
        complete various space applications, it is necessary to estimate the thrust
        performance of the microthrusters in real-time on orbit. This paper proposes
        a real-time on-orbit estimation method for microthrust based on high-precision
        orbit determination. By establishing a high-precision orbit dynamic model,
        the microthrust generated by a microthruster is modeled as a first-order Markov
        model, combined with a high-precision GNSS measuring device, and the satellite
        position is obtained through the cubature Kalman filter algorithm, velocity,
        and thrust real-time on-orbit estimates. For a thrust of 100\u2009\u03bcN,
        the error accuracy of the on-orbit estimation is 3.98%; for a thrust of 500\u2009\u03bcN,
        the error accuracy is 1.79%; for a thrust of 5\u2009mN, the error accuracy
        can be reduced to 1.43%; and when the thrust is 500\u2009\u03bcN, the accuracy
        of orbit determination is 16\u2009cm. This method solves the problem that
        the traditional on-orbit thrust estimation method cannot perform real-time
        on-orbit estimation of microthrust on the order of hundreds of \u03bcN. The
        real-time on-orbit estimation of microthrust of micro-nanosatellites equipped
        with microthrusters of the order of hundreds of micronewtons or even several
        mN to tens of mN has certain reference value.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/7733495","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]],"date-time":"2021-07-01T18:21:09Z","timestamp":1625163669000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Real-Time

        spatial organization of the nucleus is a key determinant in all genome activities.
        However, the accurate measurement of the nuclear organization is still technically
        challenging. Here, the technology NucQuant we created previously was utilized
        to detect the variation of the nuclear organization, including the heterogeneity
        of the nuclear geometry, the change of the NPC distribution along different
        cell cycle stages during interphase, and the organization of the nucleolus.
        The results confirmed that not only the growth rate and the NPC distribution
        are influenced by the carbon source; the nuclear shape is also impacted by
        the carbon source. The nuclei lost their spherical geometry gradually when
        the cell was cultured from the most to a less favorable carbon source. We
        also discovered that the nucleolus prefers to locate at the nuclear periphery,
        which was called the \u201cgenes poor region,\u201d especially when the cells
        entered quiescence. Furthermore, the distribution of the NPC along the different
        stages during the interphase was analyzed. We proposed that with the growth
        of the cell, the nucleus would grow from the surface of the NE flanking the

        aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a powerful tool to expand the existing
        ground wireless network into aerial space. Since high mobility is an essential
        characteristic for UAV, it is important to carry out an accurate, real-time,
        and high-precision localization in terms of safe operation and communication
        link maintenance. The cellular network-based localization technology has provided
        UAV a solution with both high coverage and seamless connection. However, the
        complex channel environment between the UAV and terrestrial base station (BS)
        would have weakened the localization performance. To solve this problem, a
        two-stage channel adaptive algorithm for cellular-connected UAV has been proposed.
        The first stage of the algorithm is to revise the observation error introduced
        by the complex channel environment using the model of DDPG. The second stage
        is to locate the UAV position with TDOA algorithm using the revised observation
        values. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can
        achieve the channel adaptive effect by revising the observation errors and
        improve location performance greatly, especially for UAVs at a relative lower
        altitude.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8946885","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,8]],"date-time":"2021-11-08T23:20:16Z","timestamp":1636413616000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Two-Stage

        aim of this study is to further investigate the effect of different basalt
        fiber (BF) factors on the viscoelastic equivalent creep behavior of fiber-reinforced
        asphalt mixture (FRAM) under indirect tensile (IDT) condition. A two-dimension
        mesostructural model composed of different components including fiber mortar
        polymer and coarse particle aggregate is constructed via the section image
        processing for the IDT FRAM specimen, where BF is considered as random distribution
        in the mortar polymer. Furthermore, the stress distribution and equivalent
        creep of the IDT mesostructural model in simulation software are analyzed
        to discuss the influence of components on the creep behavior of FRAM. Moreover,
        the laboratory creep test of IDT specimens under 0% and 0.3% BF contents for
        FRAM is carried out to validate the simulated values. Research results indicate
        that the simulated creep deformation of the IDT mesostructural model is in
        agreement with that of the experiment. Finally, creep simulations are further
        conducted to discuss the effect of BF (e.g., fiber content, length-diameter
        ratio, and fiber modulus) and aggregate on the creep characteristic of FRAM.
        The increase of fiber content and length-diameter ratio has a significant
        reinforcing effect on the equivalent mechanical behavior, but the change in
        the modulus of fiber and aggregate has slight effects.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6682606","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]],"date-time":"2021-02-18T01:52:32Z","timestamp":1613613152000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Viscoelastic

        with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its clinicopathologic significance
        is still unknown. A cohort of 304 patients undergoing surgical resection for
        HCC and having preoperative CA19-9 data was enrolled in this study. Serum
        CA19-9 levels were correlated with clinicopathologic factors. Univariate and
        multivariate analyses were performed to determine the predictors of patient
        survival. On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cut off
        value of CA19-9 was determined to be 27\u2009U\/mL. One hundred and six patients
        had preoperative CA19-9 values &gt;27\u2009U\/mL. High serum CA19-9 levels
        did not correlate with patient age, sex, viral status,<jats:italic>\u03b1<\/jats:italic>-fetoprotein
        level, tumor size, tumor grade, tumor stage, multiplicity, and vascular invasion.
        Patients with elevated preoperative CA19-9 levels had lower 10-year survival
        than those without CA19-9 elevation. Multivariate analysis revealed that CA19-9
        level, tumor grade, and tumor size are independent prognostic factors for
        long-term survival. In conclusion, a preoperative CA19-9 value &gt;27\u2009U\/mL

        objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic response of intravesical
        oxybutynin, propantheline, and capsaicin in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor
        overactivity. Carried out in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
        at a university teaching hospital in India, patients acted as their own controls.
        Oxybutynin 5 mg in solution or propantheline 15 mg in solution and capsaicin
        were instilled intravesically in each patient. Urodynamic studies were done
        before and after the intravesical instillation of each drug. The nonparametric
        tests were used for statistical analysis. The efficacy of intravesical capsaicin
        in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity was statistically significant
        for reflex volume (RV) (p = 0.018), cystometric capacity (CC) (p = 0.0440),
        leak volume (LV) (p = 0.000), and leak frequency (LF) (p = 0.009). The Kruskal-Wallis
        test for paired sample comparing pre- and post-LV and LF for intravesical
        capsaicin was significant at 2<jats:sup>nd<\/jats:sup>week (p = 0.002 and
        0.054, respectively). There was a significant difference in therapeutic response

        of detrusor overactivity for LV and LF at 2<jats:sup>nd<\/jats:sup>week (p
        = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively). When comparing responses of oxybutynin and
        propantheline, more subjects demonstrated improvement with intravesical propantheline
        than oxybutynin for RV, detrusor leak point pressure (LPP), clean intermittent
        catheterization volume (CICV), and LV. This study suggests that intravesical
        agents may be used as effective adjuvants in the management of incontinence

        the shock is not a common symptom of KD, it is often misdiagnosed at the beginning
        of the pathogenesis of KDSS. The language searched was only Chinese and English.
        Data from the articles were screened and extracted for meta-analysis using
        Stata16.0 software. A total of 9 cohort studies, including 1231 patients,
        were included in this meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis showed that
        the age of the children in the KDSS group was higher than that in the KD group

        Compared with KD without shock, children with KDSS are older and have a higher
        incidence of coronary artery disease, serum CRP, and AST, but albumin is lower
        than KD without shock. According to these characteristics, it may be helpful
        for the early identification of KDSS.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1486089","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]],"date-time":"2021-12-20T22:36:32Z","timestamp":1640039792000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Comparison

        mellitus is one of the most relevant noncommunicable diseases; the WHO figures
        in its latest update that 422 million people suffer from it; additionally,
        it has remained for more than 20 years within the 10 main causes of death
        worldwide; this disease affects the population at any age; glucose measurement
        is used to assist the treatment of this disease by different methods that
        are classified as invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive, the latter
        being an area of recent development due that it is not traumatic for patients.
        This work consists of the experimental characterization of an optical system
        for plasma glucometry using near infrared by spectrophotometry. This glucometry
        system is based on the employ of an infrared LED with a wavelength of 1650\u2009nm,
        a beam angle of 16\u00b0, and an output power of 1.6\u2009mW that passes through
        the analyte (glucose in blood plasma) that is contained in cuvettes of different
        materials (acrylic and quartz) to subsequently affect a photodiode with different
        active areas ranging from 0.06\u2009mm to 1.5\u2009mm in order to evaluate
        the efficiency by comparing the sensitivity in the presence of glucose making
        additions ranging 100\u2009mg\/dl\u20131000\u2009mg\/dl within a dark chamber.
        The experiments showed that the use of photodiodes with a larger active area
        and the use of quartz cuvettes show a higher sensitivity compared to photodiodes
        with small active areas and the use of acrylic cuvettes. This configuration
        presented an R2 of 0.99 and a sensitivity of 0.225\u2009mV\/1\u2009mg\/dl
        of glucose; despite the fact that the initial voltage in each of the experimental
        repetitions varies, the downward voltage pattern is maintained; based on this,
        it is concluded that this method using this setup is feasible for plasma glucose
        measurement.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/5071553","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]],"date-time":"2022-02-04T18:35:16Z","timestamp":1643999716000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Comparison

        syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly that involves several organs. Patients

        pulmonary valve stenosis, anomalies of genitalia, retardation of growth, and
        deafness. The syndrome is rare, and only 200 cases have been reported yet

        To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tongning Gel (TNG) compared to placebo-controlled
        (PC) for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). <jats:italic>Methods<\/jats:italic>. A
        multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled, clinical
        trial was performed in 576 patients (432 patients in the TNG group, 144 patients
        in the PC group), and 1 in the experimental group withdrew due to nonuse of
        drug. Patients were randomized to receive TNG or PC applied to knee skin at
        3g per time, 2 times per day, which lasted for 3 weeks. The Western Ontario
        and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score was used to evaluate
        the primary efficacy of TNG and WOMAC stiffness and physical function and
        total scores were used to evaluate the secondary efficacy of TNG. All participants
        who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis.
        This trial has been registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (no. <jats:ext-link

        <jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>. Primary efficiency outcome: there were
        significant differences in the decreased value of WOMAC pain score between
        two groups (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>P<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>),
        and the decreased value of WOMAC pain score in the TNG group were better than

        Secondary efficiency outcome: the WOMAC total score, WOMAC stiffness score,
        WOMAC physical function score, and the decrease of the above indexes of the
        two groups of patients after treatment were statistically significant (<mml:math

        and the improvement of the above indexes in the TNG group was better than
        that of the PC group (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M4\"><mml:mi>P<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>).
        <jats:italic>Safety Evaluation<\/jats:italic>. A total of 42 adverse events
        were reported by 29 patients: 25 adverse events reported by 16 patients (3.71%)
        in the experimental group and 17 adverse events were reported by 13 patients
        (9.03%) in the control group. And 8 adverse reactions were reported by 6 patients
        including 2 adverse reactions by 2 patients (0.46%) in the experimental group
        and 6 adverse reactions by 4 patients (2.78%) in the control group. Two cases
        of significant adverse events occurred in the experimental group. Both groups
        had one serious adverse event, respectively, which were not relevant to the
        intervention. <jats:italic>Conclusion<\/jats:italic>. These results of the
        trial demonstrate that TNG is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients
        with KOA, and TNG can improve other symptoms of KOA, such as stiffness and
        physical function. TNG is safe for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis as
        a whole.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/8707256","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,11]],"date-time":"2020-06-11T23:31:41Z","timestamp":1591918301000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Efficacy

        solidification\/stabilization is a commonly used method for the remediation
        of contaminated soils. The stability characteristics of solidified\/stabilized

        tests, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests, are performed to study

        methane recovery enhanced by hydraulic or nonaqueous fracturing methods has
        been studied for decades, and it is of significance to evaluate fracturing
        results and scope for field applications. Monitoring variation in velocity
        is one way to explain fracturing effects. However, the existence of residual
        water or gas within cracks or pores may affect velocity measurements, and
        the correlation between velocity and inherent coal attributes (such as density
        and porosity) has not been studied comprehensively. In this paper, coal of
        different ranks (lignite, bituminite, and anthracite) was prepared under water
        and gas saturation to approximately simulate the residual water and gas in
        cracks under field applications. Correlations between the velocity and coal
        attributes were studied. For both water- and gas-saturated cores, the diverse
        velocity distributions were highly correlated to rank and saturation media.
        The longitudinal ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPVp) and transverse ultrasonic
        pulse velocity (UPVs) of different cores were distributed differently. For
        coal saturated with water or gas, the UPVp values of lignite, bituminite,
        and anthracite had positive linear correlations with the corresponding UPVs
        values. The discrete velocity ratio data were fit as negative linear correlations
        with UPVs, and different coals had different declining degrees, the difference
        of which might be attributed to the characteristics of structural cracks and
        the inherent properties of the coal, such as grain size and pore shape, which
        result in decreasing coal integrity and strength. Moreover, the difference
        in acoustic resistance between coal and fluids might have an inverse impact
        on the acoustic energy, and a larger difference might cause a large amount
        of energy to dissipate and finally cause the velocity to decrease. Under water
        and gas saturation conditions, the UPVp showed a positive linear correlation
        with density and a negative linear correlation with porosity. Finally, a potential
        field application was designed on the relations between the velocity and the
        elastic parameters to estimate fracturing effects by monitoring the petrophysical
        parameters of coal lithologies.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/3729381","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]],"date-time":"2019-05-02T23:33:40Z","timestamp":1556840020000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Investigation

        development of complex simulation systems is extremely costly as it requires
        high computational capability and expensive hardware. As cost is one of the
        main issues in developing simulation components, achieving real-time simulation
        is challenging and it often leads to intensive computational burdens. Overcoming
        the computational burden in a multidisciplinary simulation system that has
        several subsystems is essential in producing inexpensive real-time simulation.
        In this paper, a surrogate-based computational framework was proposed to reduce
        the computational cost in a high-dimensional model while maintaining accurate
        simulation results. Several well-known metamodeling techniques were used in
        creating a global surrogate model. Decomposition approaches were also used
        to simplify the complexities of the system and to guide the surrogate modeling
        processes. In addition, a case study was provided to validate the proposed
        approach. A surrogate-based vehicle dynamic model (SBVDM) was developed to
        reduce computational delay in a real-time driving simulator. The results showed
        that the developed surrogate-based model was able to significantly reduce
        the computing costs, unlike the expensive computational model. The response
        time in surrogate-based simulation was considerably faster than the conventional
        model. Therefore, the proposed framework can be used in developing low-cost
        simulation systems while yielding high fidelity and fast computational output.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2017\/1686230","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,6]],"date-time":"2017-03-06T16:05:33Z","timestamp":1488816333000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Decomposition-Assisted

        investigated effects of cooling rates on self-assembling structures and mechanical
        and electrochemical properties of 12-hydroxystearic acid (12-HSA) in an ionic
        liquid (IL), 1-allyl-3-butylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide
        ([ABIm][TFSI]). The mixture of 12-HSA with [ABIm][TFSI] had an upper critical
        solution temperature (UCST) above the sol-gel transition temperature, and
        the microstructure of the ionogel was significantly affected by cooling rates,
        where it was prepared. The twisted self-assembling structure was formed during
        a slow cooling process at a rate of 0.4\u00b0C\/min, whereas spherical domains
        caused by the liquid-liquid phase separation and radiate fibrous structure
        were observed for the quenched gel. The real-time small-angle X-ray scattering
        (SAXS) measurements for the ionogel during a slow cooling process at a rate
        of 0.4\u00b0C\/min presented three different (001) peaks arising from long
        spacings of 46.5, 42.4, and 39.7\u2009\u00c5, which were also observed for
        SAXS curves of a neat 12-HSA. These results suggest that three polymorphic
        forms of 12-HSA are formed in the IL. The polymorphic form significantly affected
        the mechanical properties of the ionogel, whereas it did not affect the ionic
        conductivity. The ionic conductivity of the ionogel was close to that of a
        neat [ABIm][TFSI] irrespective of the polymorphic forms of 12-HSA.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2017\/4762379","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,13]],"date-time":"2017-09-13T17:01:08Z","timestamp":1505322068000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Effects

        The second algorithm is a generalization of the first one with using the jump
        operator, where generalized encryption map has an essentially higher degree
        in comparison with the previous version. Moreover, the degree of this generalized
        map is not bounded by some constant. This property guarantees resistance of
        the cipher to linearization attacks.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/2137561","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]],"date-time":"2019-04-01T23:32:31Z","timestamp":1554161551000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["On

        girl aged 6 presented with haematuria and her sister (aged 5) presented with
        haematuria and proteinuria. Family history showed multiple individuals suffering
        from end stage renal failure from the paternal side of the pedigree. Following
        kidney biopsy in the father and paternal grandmother, the pathological diagnosis
        was of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Exome sequencing was undertaken
        in the proband''s sister and grandmother. Genetic variants shared by both
        affected individuals were interrogated to identify the genetic cause of disease.
        Candidate variants were then sequenced in all the family members to determine
        segregation with the disease. A mutation of <jats:italic>COL4A5<\/jats:italic>
        known to cause Alport syndrome segregated with disease from the paternal side
        of the pedigree and a variant in <jats:italic>NPHS1<\/jats:italic> was present
        in both paediatric cases and inherited from their mother. This study highlights
        the advantages of exome sequencing over single gene testing; disease presentation
        can be heterogeneous with several genes representing plausible candidates;
        candidate gene(s) may be unavailable as a diagnostic test; consecutive, single
        gene testing typically concludes once a single causal mutation is identified.
        In this family, we were able to confirm a diagnosis of Alport syndrome, which
        will facilitate testing in other family members.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0016672313000220","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,28]],"date-time":"2014-01-28T14:47:18Z","timestamp":1390920438000},"page":"165-173","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["Exome

        continuous nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode (NFTSM) control scheme with
        the extended state observer (ESO) and the tracking differentiator (TD) is
        proposed for second-order uncertain SISO nonlinear systems. The system\u2019s
        disturbances and states can be estimated by introducing the ESO, then the
        disturbances are compensated effectively, and the ideal transient process
        of the system can be arranged based on TD to provide the target tracking signal
        and its high-order derivatives. The proposed controller obtains finite-time
        convergence property and keeps good robustness of sliding mode control (SMC)
        for disturbances. Moreover, compared with conventional SMC, the proposed control
        law is continuous and no chattering phenomenon exists. The property of system
        stability is guaranteed by Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation results
        show that the proposed method can be employed to shorten the system reaching
        time, improve the system tracking precision, and suppress the system chattering
        and the input noise. The proposed control method is finally applied for the
        rotating control problem of theodolite servo system.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/639707","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,27]],"date-time":"2014-10-27T21:05:12Z","timestamp":1414443912000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["Nonsingular

        from the toxicity study. The occurrence of adverse events was evaluated 1
        day before and 1, 14, and 28 days after BM-MSC therapy. Additionally, we assessed
        changes in the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) score 3 months after BM-MSC
        treatment. Results. One serious adverse drug reaction (ADR) of leptomeningeal
        enhancement following the intra-arterial BM-MSC administration occurred in
        one patient in the low-dose group. The safety review of the Internal Monitoring
        Committee interpreted this as radiological evidence of the blood-brain barrier
        permeability for MSCs. No other ADRs were observed in the medium- or high-dose
        groups. In particular, no ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted images were
        observed in any of the study participants. Additionally, the medium- and high-dose
        groups tended to show a slower increase in UMSARS scores than the low-dose
        group during the 3-month follow-up. Conclusion. The present study confirmed
        that a single intra-arterial administration of autologous BM-MSCs is a safe
        and promising neuroprotective strategy in patients with MSA-C.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/9886877","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,20]],"date-time":"2021-10-20T04:00:46Z","timestamp":1634702446000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Phase

        smoothing strategies combined with autoregressive integrated moving average
        (ARIMA) and autoregressive neural networks (ANNs) models to improve the forecasting
        of time series are presented. The strategy of forecasting is implemented using
        two stages. In the first stage the time series is smoothed using either, 3-point
        moving average smoothing, or singular value Decomposition of the Hankel matrix
        (HSVD). In the second stage, an ARIMA model and two ANNs for one-step-ahead
        time series forecasting are used. The coefficients of the first ANN are estimated
        through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) learning algorithm, while the
        coefficients of the second ANN are estimated with the resilient backpropagation
        (RPROP) learning algorithm. The proposed models are evaluated using a weekly
        time series of traffic accidents of Valpara\u00edso, Chilean region, from
        2003 to 2012. The best result is given by the combination HSVD-ARIMA, with
        a MAPE of 0\u2009:\u200926%, followed by MA-ARIMA with a MAPE of 1\u2009:\u200912%;

        paper considers generation self-scheduling in electricity markets under uncertain
        price. Based on the robust optimization (denoted as RO) methodology, a new
        self-scheduling model, which has a complicated max-min optimization structure,
        is set up. By using optimal dual theory, the proposed model is reformulated
        to an ordinary quadratic and quadratic cone programming problems in the cases
        of box and ellipsoidal uncertainty, respectively. IEEE 30-bus system is used
        to test the new model. Some comparisons with other methods are done, and the
        sensitivity with respect to the uncertain set is analyzed. Comparing with
        the existed uncertain self-scheduling approaches, the new method has twofold
        characteristics. First, it does not need a prediction of distribution of random
        variables and just requires an estimated value and the uncertain set of power
        price. Second, the counterpart of RO corresponding to the self-scheduling
        is a simple quadratic or quadratic cone programming. This indicates that the
        reformulated problem can be solved by many ordinary optimization algorithms.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2011\/497014","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,23]],"date-time":"2011-03-23T19:32:04Z","timestamp":1300908724000},"page":"1-17","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Robust

        Antenna Systems (DAS) are an alternative of network deployment that allows
        reducing the distance between transmitter and receiver by distributing the
        antennas throughout the coverage area. Moreover, the performance of the millimeter
        wave (mmWave) band can be significantly high within short transmitter-receiver
        distances. In this paper, the potential benefits of DAS deployments in the
        mmWave band are studied. To this aim, a distributed hybrid precoding (DHP)
        solution with remote antenna unit (RAU) selection capabilities is proposed
        and analyzed in an indoor DAS working in mmWaves and compared to two other
        indoor deployment strategies: a conventional cellular system with colocated
        antenna arrays and a small cell deployment. The results show that, using DHP,
        DAS not only brings huge gains to cell-edge users rate but also increases
        system capacity, becoming the best overall deployment. Further simulations
        including practical limitations have revealed that DAS using DHP is quite
        robust to combiner losses, although its performance is significantly degraded
        by outdated channel reports.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2017\/5751809","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,8]],"date-time":"2017-10-08T21:01:14Z","timestamp":1507496474000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Distributed

        this paper, a recognition model based on the improved hybrid particle swarm
        optimisation (HPSO) optimised backpropagation network (BP) is proposed to
        improve the efficiency of radar working state recognition. First, the model
        improves the HPSO algorithm through the nonlinear decreasing inertia weight
        by adding the deceleration factor and asynchronous learning factor. Then,
        the BP neural network\u2019s initial weights and thresholds are optimised
        to overcome the shortcomings of slow convergence rate and falling into local
        optima. In the simulation experiment, improved HPSO-BP recognition models
        were established based on the datasets for three radar types, and these models
        were subsequently compared to other recognition models. The results reveal
        that the improved HPSO-BP recognition model has better prediction accuracy
        and convergence rate. The recognition accuracy of different radar types exceeded
        97%, which demonstrates the feasibility and generalisation of the model applied

        property of the matrix inequality, a sufficient condition for the existence
        of the desired state estimator for Markovian jump systems with missing measurements
        can be achieved by solving some linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily
        facilitated by using the standard numerical software. Furthermore, the gain
        of state estimator can also be derived based on the known conditions. Finally,
        a numerical example is exploited to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
        method.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/379565","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,4,3]],"date-time":"2014-04-03T21:04:24Z","timestamp":1396559064000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["State

        order to solve the dynamic vibration characteristics of the power-split transmission
        system, the system of the dynamic mechanical model is established. Firstly,
        according to the theoretical analysis method of the tooth contact analysis
        (TCA) and loaded tooth contact analysis (LTCA), the actual meshing process
        of each gear pair is simulated, and the time-varying mesh stiffness excitation
        is obtained, which can improve the numerical precision. Next, by using the
        lumped mass method, the bending-torsional coupling three-dimensional dynamical
        model of the power-split transmission is established. The identical dimensionless
        equations are deduced by eliminating the effect of rigid displacement and
        the method of dimensional normalization. Next, the frequency domain and time
        domain responses of this system are obtained. The dynamic load change characteristics
        of each gear pair are analyzed. The results show that establishment, solution,
        and analysis of the system dynamics model could provide a basis for the dynamic
        design and have an important significance for the dynamic efficiency analysis
        and dynamic performance optimization design of the power-split transmission.
        Through theoretical data compared with the experimental data, we verified

        antibodies are one of the most important parts of the pharmaceutical industry.
        They are widely used in treating various diseases such as autoimmune diseases,
        cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases. Their development process however
        is often brought to a standstill or takes a longer time and is then more expensive
        due to their hydrophobicity problems. Hydrophobic interactions can cause problems
        on half-life, drug administration, and immunogenicity at all stages of antibody
        drug development. Some of the most widely accepted and used technologies for
        determining the hydrophobic interactions of antibodies include standup monolayer
        adsorption chromatography (SMAC), salt-gradient affinity-capture self-interaction
        nanoparticle spectroscopy (SGAC-SINS), and hydrophobic interaction chromatography
        (HIC). However, to measure SMAC, SGAC-SINS, and HIC for hundreds of antibody
        drug candidates is time-consuming and costly. To save time and money, a predictor
        called SSH is developed. Based on the antibody\u2019s sequence only, it can
        predict the hydrophobic interactions of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Using
        the leave-one-out crossvalidation, SSH achieved 91.226% accuracy, 96.396%

        is a need in critical care units for continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring
        techniques. ECG gated electrical impedance tomography is able to localize
        the impedance variations occurring during the cardiac cycle. This method is
        a safe, inexpensive and potentially fast technique for cardiac output imaging
        but the spatial resolution is presently low, particularly for central locations
        such as the heart. Many parameters including noise deteriorate the reconstruction
        result. One of the main obstacles in cardiac imaging at the heart location
        is the high impedance of lungs and muscles on the dorsal and posterior side
        of body. In this study we are investigating improvements of the measurement
        and initial conductivity estimation of the internal electrode by modelling
        an internal electrode inside the esophagus. We consider 16 electrodes connected
        around a cylindrical mesh. With the random noise level set near 0.05% of the
        signal we evaluated the Graz consensus reconstruction algorithm for electrical
        impedance tomography. The modelling and simulation results showed that the
        quality of the target in reconstructed images was improved by up to 5 times

        survey was undertaken to characterize the honey production value chain and
        identify the challenges, limitations, and opportunities for beekeepers in
        Kayonza District, Eastern Rwanda, in light of the stagnation of the apiculture
        industry. The majority (86%, n = 100) of the beekeepers were adult males.
        Most of the respondents (71%) lacked primary level education. The majority
        of the hives were made from hollow tree logs (40%), tree barks (12%), banana
        leaves\/bark (11%), cow dung (8%), mud (7%), grass (6%), tree leaves (6%),
        and the rest (20%) were improved beehives, particularly Langstroth hives.
        The hive pests encountered were hive beetles (25%), small black ants (19%),
        wax moths (12%), lizards (8%), termites (7%), birds (6%), mites (3%), and
        mice (2%). Fifty-five percent of the respondents hung their hives on trees
        to prevent pest invasion with 95% effectiveness, 25% frequently smoked their
        hives with 85% effectiveness, 16% cleared the bushes around apiaries with
        55% effectiveness, and 4% used traditional plant insect repellents with 35%
        effectiveness. Forty-one percent of the respondents lacked adequate information
        on beekeeping, 25% had inadequate time to work on apiaries, 24% had inadequate
        technical knowledge and implements, and 10% needed additional labour for managing
        apiaries. Based on the results of this study, beekeeping in Kayonza is still
        largely traditional, characterized by the use of antiquated production methods
        and underutilization of available marketing channels. Perceptions in the district
        are that beekeeping is for the poor and illiterate. Challenges and limitations
        of beekeeping in Kayonza District include lack of education, gender bias,
        pests and diseases, absconding and swarming of bees, high costs, and lack
        of modern apicultural equipment. However, the potential for developing beekeeping
        enterprise (opportunities) is immense given the abundance of wild bee populations,
        possibility of women participation, abundance of honey collection centres
        (market), and availability of technical support from Government and development
        agencies. In conclusion, this study advocates the need for intervention measures
        to educate and promote production and marketing of quality honey, tackle pest
        and disease for beekeepers and boost Rwanda\u2019s apiculture industry.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/5982931","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,22]],"date-time":"2019-05-22T23:38:02Z","timestamp":1558568282000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Characterization

        stainless steels (DSSs) often have bad hot workability. In this study, specimens
        of 2205 DSS were hot tensioned over a strain rate range from 0.005\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>
        to 50\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup> to examine the hot ductility. The
        crack morphology was observed, and the dependence of hot ductility on the
        strain rate was analyzed. From 0.005\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup> to
        0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>, both the total elongation and the
        reduction in area increased with the strain rate. The reduction in area exhibited
        a small decrease when the strain rate was greater than 0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>.
        More than 85% of cracks formed between the ferrite and austenite, and no less
        than 70% of crack tips propagated between the ferrite and austenite. When
        the strain rate was increased from 0.005\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>
        to 0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>, dynamic recrystallization was
        promoted in the austenite, and the number fraction of low-angle grain boundaries
        in the ferrite was improved. The higher strain rate reduced the difference
        between ferrite and austenite in hardness, which improved the hot ductility.
        For 2205 DDS, the suggested strain rate is 0.5\u2009s<jats:sup>\u20131<\/jats:sup>
        and above to avoid surface and edge cracking during hot forging or hot rolling.
        The findings will be of value for the understanding of hot ductility of DSSs
        and other dual-phase alloys.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/6810326","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,5]],"date-time":"2019-08-05T23:31:28Z","timestamp":1565047888000},"page":"1-6","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Effect

        present, the news broadcast system using mobile network on the market provides
        the basic functions required by TV stations, but there are still many problems
        and shortcomings. In view of the main problems existing in the current system
        and combined with the actual needs of current users, this paper has preliminarily
        developed a news broadcast system based on 5G Live. The card frame adaptive
        strategy significantly improves the user experience by using gradual video
        frame buffering technology. Hardware codec technology significantly reduces
        the consumption of system resources; H.264 high-compression algorithm can
        reduce network bandwidth by 50% compared with MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 without a
        significant change in image quality. At the same time, the use of mobile video
        acquisition terminals in the system not only solves the problem that satellite
        broadcast vehicles cannot reach the site due to the lack of roads but also
        greatly reduces the cost of early deployment and late maintenance of the news
        broadcast system. This paper studies the card frame adaptive strategy, the
        system resource consumption reduction solution, and the deployment scheme
        of the mobile video and audio transmission terminal, which is of great significance
        to improve the design and research of the news broadcast system under the
        wireless network application and also has certain reference value for the
        design of other broadcasting and television solutions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/9936803","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]],"date-time":"2021-04-21T01:36:09Z","timestamp":1618968969000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Consumption

        This article describes the process and evaluation of a smoking cessation support

        The objective of the study was to assess a group-based smoking cessation support
        model for community mental health clients.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:<\/jats:bold>
        Two community mental health services participated; 29 clients received free
        NRT products and weekly education for 12 weeks on: effects of smoking, nicotine
        dependence, NRT use, withdrawal process and the benefits of quitting. Evaluation
        included face-to-face interviews, telephone or postal survey using a semi-structured
        questionnaire.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold> The baseline
        (n = 29) and follow-up (n = 14) surveys showed reduction in the number of
        cigarettes (30 to 21) smoked a day (55% vs. 36%). At one month 47% (n = 19)
        were confident about stopping smoking permanently whereas 19% (n = 14) reported
        the same after six months. Participants reported concerns of health effects,
        illness, physical symptoms (77% n = 27) and financial cost (93% n = 27) were
        the motivating factors in quitting. None of the findings was statistically
        significant.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold> Community
        based interventions to address the rate of smoking in this group is needed.
        Financial and health benefits can be used as motivating factors, and integration
        of smoking cessation assistance in treatment and rehabilitation of mental
        health consumers would be useful.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/jsc.2013.16","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,28]],"date-time":"2013-08-28T07:52:34Z","timestamp":1377676354000},"page":"26-30","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["A

        underwent a detailed neurological examination. Verbal and nonverbal intelligence,
        memory, executive functions, and verbal fluency w\u0435re assessed in all
        the patients aged 4 to 47 years. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed
        in 20 affected patients. Eighteen affected were classified as having mild
        intellectual deficit, whereas 4 had borderline intelligence. In all psychometric
        tests, evaluating different cognitive domains, CCFDN patients had statistically
        significant lower scores when compared to the healthy control group. All cognitive
        domains seemed equally affected. The main abnormalities on brain MRI found
        in 19\/20 patients included diffuse cerebral atrophy, enlargement of the lateral
        ventricles, and focal lesions in the subcortical white matter, different in
        number and size, consistent with demyelination more pronounced in the older
        CCFDN patients. The correlation analysis of the structural brain changes and
        the cognitive impairment found a statistically significant correlation only

        secret sharing schemes are those that have multipartite access structures.
        The set of the participants in those schemes is divided into several parts,
        and all the participants in the same part play the equivalent role. One type
        of such access structure is the compartmented access structure, and the other
        is the hierarchical access structure. We propose an efficient compartmented
        multisecret sharing scheme based on the linear homogeneous recurrence (LHR)
        relations. In the construction phase, the shared secrets are hidden in some
        terms of the linear homogeneous recurrence sequence. In the recovery phase,
        the shared secrets are obtained by solving those terms in which the shared
        secrets are hidden. When the global threshold is <jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        our scheme can reduce the computational complexity of the compartmented secret
        sharing schemes from the exponential time to polynomial time. The security
        of the proposed scheme is based on Shamir\u2019s threshold scheme, i.e., our
        scheme is perfect and ideal. Moreover, it is efficient to share the multisecret
        and to change the shared secrets in the proposed scheme.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5566179","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]],"date-time":"2021-07-21T00:05:08Z","timestamp":1626825908000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["An

        ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system in a large action space, principally
        for the cases with high computation and convergence time. The method employs
        the multistep action-network and search tree to generate the original state
        and then selects the optimal state based on the value-network for the original
        and the adjacent states. The results from the application of the MAC algorithm
        to a simulation problem on the TRNSYS system, where the simulation problem
        is referring to a real supertall building in Hong Kong, have shown that the
        proposed MAC algorithm balances control actions between different HVAC subsystems.

        improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of severe patients with advanced
        liver cancer and enhance the effect of chemotherapy treatment, the U-Net model
        was optimized by introducing the batch normalization (BN) layer and the dropout
        layer, and the segmentation training and verification of the optimized model
        were realized by the magnetic resonance (MR) image data. Subsequently, HepG2
        cells were taken as the research objects and treated with 0, 10, 20, 40, 60,
        80, and 100\u2009\u03bcmol\/L emodin (EMO), respectively. The methyl thiazolyl

        iodide (PI) (Annexin V-FITC\/PI) was adopted to detect the apoptosis after
        EMO treatment, and the Western blot (WB) method was used with the purpose
        of exploring the changes in protein expression levels of PARP, Bcl-2, and
        p53 in the cells after treatment. It was found that compared with the original
        U-Net model, the introduction of the BN layer and the dropout layer can improve
        the robustness of the U-Net model, and the optimized U-Net model had the highest

        is the study of alterations in the function of genes that do not involve changes
        in the DNA sequence. Within the critical care literature, it is a relatively
        new and exciting avenue of research in describing pathology, clinical course,
        and developing targeted therapies to improve outcomes. In this paper, we highlight
        current research relative to critical care that is focused within the major
        epigenetic mechanisms of DNA methylation, histone modification, microRNA regulation,
        and composite epigenetic scoring. Within this emerging body of research it
        is quite clear that the novel therapies of the future will require clinicians
        to understand and navigate an even more complex and multivariate relationship
        between genetic, epigenetic, and biochemical mechanisms in conjunction with
        clinical presentation and course in order to significantly improve outcomes
        within the acute and critically ill population.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2013\/503686","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,7,9]],"date-time":"2013-07-09T17:01:25Z","timestamp":1373389285000},"page":"1-5","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Epigenetics

        died within 30 min after the commencement of LPS infusion (non-survivors),

        of shock (survivors). No alterations were observed in plasma concentrations
        of eicosanoids in the non-survivors. A significant, though transient, increase
        in eicosanoid concentrations occurred only in the survivors. Treatment with
        BN 52021 (4 mg kg-1, i.v.) injected 5 min prior to LPS infusion, failed to
        exert any effect on the survival rate. However, pretreatment with BN 52021
        prevented circulatory collapse in the survivors and reduced the concentration

        modeling has become an indispensable part of systems biology which is a discipline
        that has become increasingly popular in recent years. In this context, our
        understanding of bistable signaling pathways in terms of mathematical modeling
        is of particular importance because such bistable components perform crucial
        functions in living cells. Bistable signaling pathways can act as switches
        or memory functions and can determine cell fate. In the present study, properties
        of mathematical models of bistable signaling pathways are examined from the
        perspective of synergetics, a theory of self-organization and pattern formation
        founded by Hermann Haken. At the heart of synergetics is the concept of so-called
        unstable modes or order parameters that determine the behavior of systems
        as a whole close to bifurcation points. How to determine these order parameters
        for bistable signaling pathways at saddle-node bifurcation points is shown.

        complications continue to be a major cause of morbidity after split-liver

        segment VI-VII draining in the left duct was unidentified and tied at the

        of the dilated intrahepatic ducts by a percutaneous embolization using an

        of a dilated bile duct seems to be a safe procedure with good results providing
        a less invasive option than hepatic resection and decreasing the morbidity

        growing worldwide interests in commercial, scientific, and military issues,
        there has been a corresponding rapid growth in demand for the development
        of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with more reliable and safer motion control
        abilities. This paper presents a new nonlinear path following scheme integrated
        with a heading control law for achieving accurate and reliable path following
        performance. Both backstepping and finite-time techniques are employed for
        developing the path following and heading control strategies capable of minimizing
        cross-track errors in finite-time with elegant transient performance, while
        the barrier Lyapunov function scheme is adopted to limit turning rates of
        the UAV for preventing it from capsizing which may be induced by overquick
        steering actions. A fixed-time nonlinear estimator, based on UAV kinematics,
        is designed for estimating the uncertainties with sideslip angles caused by
        external disturbances and inertial motions. To avoid the complicated calculation
        of derivatives of virtual control terms in backstepping, command filters and
        auxiliary systems are likewise introduced in the design of control laws. Extensive
        numerical simulation studies on a nonlinear UAV model are conducted to demonstrate

        collocated transmit-receive and collocated transmit distributed receive, the

        systems at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Several numerical simulations
        are carried out to demonstrate that the performance improvement is hard for
        MIMO and FDA-MIMO by only increasing the number of transmit elements, while
        it is achievable for the FDA. The paper finally makes a comparative analysis

        thermal power supply chain differs from other supply chains in terms of supplier
        selection, materials transportation, products marketing, and so on. Therefore,
        the green coal supplier evaluation model has its own characteristics. Although
        many methods have been developed to solve the green supplier evaluation problem,
        little is known about how to evaluate the green coal supplier in the thermal
        power supply chain. To overcome this drawback, an evaluation index system
        for the green coal supplier is established, and new indexes such as price
        based on calorific value, quality indexes based on the designed coal type,
        and transportation indexes such as transportation carbon footprint and environment
        indexes are created according to the characteristic of the thermal power supply
        chain. Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to create the main
        evaluation indexes, and the support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for the
        evaluation model. Finally, a practical example is applied to show that the

        the performance-based design of earthquake-resistant structures, researchers
        have recently proposed protection systems where base isolation devices are
        supplemented by active control mechanisms. Established approaches to understanding
        this problem domain rely on numerical and experimental analyses, which have
        the disadvantage of obscuring potential insight into cause-and-effect relationships
        existing between parameters of sub-optimal control and their affect on linear
        and nonlinear system response. As a first step toward mitigating this limitation,
        this paper explores the role of symbolic analysis in understanding how sub-optimal
        bang-bang control mechanisms depend on design objectives and their impact
        on performance of base isolated structures. New results are obtained through
        three avenues of investigation: (1) Single- and two-degree-of-freedom systems,
        (2) Restricted classes of multi-degree-of-freedom systems, and (3) Sensitivity
        of parameters in modified bang-bang control to localized nonlinear deformations
        in the base isolation devices. The principle outcome is matrices of symbolic
        expressions for bang-bang control expressed in terms of the structural system
        parameters and state. We identify modeling constraints and limits (e.g., perfect
        isolation) where lengthy symbolic expressions simplify to the point where
        relationships between the inner workings of the bang-bang control strategy
        and specific design objectives become evident.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2009\/676702","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,5]],"date-time":"2014-01-05T14:05:48Z","timestamp":1388930748000},"page":"195-211","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Symbolic

        diagnosis and detection have become important in modern production due to
        the importance of spinning equipment. Artificial neural network pattern recognition
        methods are widely utilized in rotating equipment fault detection. These methods
        often need a large quantity of sample data to train the model; however, sample
        data (especially fault samples) are uncommon in engineering. Preliminary work
        focuses on dimensionality reduction for big data sets using semisupervised
        methods. The rotary machine\u2019s polar coordinate signal is used to build
        a GAN network structure. ANN and tiny samples are utilized to identify DCGAN
        model flaws. The time-conditional generative adversarial network is proposed
        for one-dimensional vibration signal defect identification under data imbalance.
        Finally, auxiliary samples are gathered under similar conditions, and CCNs
        learn about target sample characteristics. Convolutional neural networks handle
        the problem of defect identification with small samples in different ways.
        In high-dimensional data sets with nonlinearities, low fault type recognition
        rates and fewer marked fault samples may be addressed using kernel semisupervised
        local Fisher discriminant analysis. The SELF method is used to build the optimum
        projection transformation matrix from the data set. The KNN classifier then
        learns low-dimensional features and detects an error kind. Because DCGAN training
        is unstable and the results are incorrect, an improved deep convolutional
        generative adversarial network (IDCGAN) is proposed. The tests indicate that
        the IDCGAN generates more real samples and solves the problem of defect identification
        in small samples. Time-conditional generation adversarial network data improvement
        lowers fault diagnosis effort and deep learning model complexity. The TCGAN
        and CNN are combined to provide superior fault detection under data imbalance.
        Modeling and experiments demonstrate TCGAN\u2019s use and superiority.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1761446","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,23]],"date-time":"2021-12-23T21:55:29Z","timestamp":1640296529000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Rotating

        the setting of the curative oncological surgery, the gastric surgery is exposed
        to complicated upper gastrointestinal leaks, and consequently the management
        of this problem has become more critically focused than was previously possible.
        We report here three cases of placement of a partially silicone-coated SEMS
        (Evolution Controlled Release Esophageal Stent System, Cook Medical, Winston-Salem,
        NC, USA) in patients who underwent total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y end-to-side
        esophagojejunostomy for a gastric adenocarcinoma. The promising results of
        our report, despite the small number of patients, suggest that early stenting
        (through a partially silicone-coated SEMS) is a feasible alternative to surgical
        treatment in this subset of patients. In fact, in the treatment of leakage
        after total gastrectomy, plastic stents and totally covered metallic stents
        may not adhere sufficiently to the esophagojejunal walls and, as a result,
        migrate beyond the anastomosis. However, prospective studies with a larger
        number of patients might assess the real effectiveness and safety of this
        procedure.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/409283","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,10,9]],"date-time":"2014-10-09T17:13:23Z","timestamp":1412874803000},"page":"1-5","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Self-Expandable

        the real vision system, lens always inevitably contains nonlinear distortion,
        which leads to geometric distortion of digital image, so it must be corrected.
        In this paper, a nonmetric correction algorithm for lens distortion based
        on entropy measure is proposed. The algorithm uses the imaging characteristics
        of the space line in the ideal perspective model, and the distortion entropy
        is defined to measure the degree of lens distortion. For distortion curves
        with different distribution, the calculation dimension of distortion entropy
        measure is uniform, which can reduce the influence of curve inhomogeneity.
        On this basis, the modified distortion entropy measure with normalized weight
        is put forward to enhance the capability of noise suppression, and the distortion
        correction performance of the traditional interior point optimization algorithm,
        basic artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, and Gbest-guided artificial bee
        colony (GABC) algorithm is compared and analyzed. The simulation experiments
        demonstrate that the correction performance of GABC to optimize the modified
        distortion entropy measure with normalized weight is best, and it has strong
        robustness to noise. Finally, the actual image distortion correction examples
        verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/4230185","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,4]],"date-time":"2018-02-04T18:31:01Z","timestamp":1517769061000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Nonmetric

        To analyze the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) combined with
        radiation therapy (also known as radiotherapy) for prostate cancer. Methods.
        The clinical data of 94 prostate cancer patients treated in the Oncology Department
        of Xiangzhou People\u2019s Hospital from January 2017 to January 2018 were
        retrospectively analyzed, and the patients were divided into the combined
        group and the reference group according to their admission order, with 47
        cases each. The patients in the reference group only received the radiotherapy,
        and on this basis, those in the combined group accepted ADT, so as to evaluate
        the efficacy of different treatment methods by comparing the patients\u2019
        serum total prostate-specific antigen (T-PSA), vascular endothelial growth
        factor (VEGF), and other indicators and analyze the relevant factors affecting
        patients\u2019 prognosis by Cox single-factor and multi-factor regression
        models. Results. Compared with the reference group after treatment, the patients
        in the combined group obtained significantly lower T-PSA and VEGF levels (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        and after the multi-factor research, it was found that the Gleason score of
        8\u201310, positive lymphatic metastasis, and single radiotherapy were the
        factors affecting the clinical prognosis of prostate cancer. Conclusion. Combining
        ADT with radiotherapy ensures a better survival benefit for prostate cancer
        patients and has a fairly well efficacy. Further study will be conducive to
        establishing a better solution for such patients.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/2237069","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,9]],"date-time":"2021-11-09T23:20:06Z","timestamp":1636500006000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Efficacy

        deep learning has made great achievements in the field of rotating machinery
        fault diagnosis. But in the practical engineering scenarios, when facing a
        large number of unlabeled data and variable operating conditions, only using
        a deep learning algorithm may reduce the performance. In order to solve the
        above problem, this paper uses a method of combining transfer learning with
        deep learning. First, the deep shrinkage residual network is constructed by
        adding soft thresholds to extract the characteristics of bearing vibration
        data under noise redundancy. Then, the joint maximum mean deviation (JMMD)
        criterion and conditional domain adversarial (CDA) learning domain adapting
        network are used to align the source and target domains. At the same time,
        adding transferable semantic augmentation (TSA) regular items improves alignment
        performance between classes. Finally, the proposed model is verified by three
        experiments: variable load, variable speed, and variable noise, which overcomes
        the shortcomings of traditional deep learning and shallow transfer learning
        algorithms.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5714240","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]],"date-time":"2021-12-07T01:05:12Z","timestamp":1638839112000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Bearing

        paper analyzes government subsidies based on the service design (i.e., headway)
        and fare structures of an urban rail transit system while considering necessary
        financial support from the government. To capture the interactions among the
        operator performance, government subsidies, and passengers in an urban rail
        transit system, a profit maximization model with nonnegative profit constraint
        is formulated to determine the optimal fare and headway solutions. Then, the
        social welfare that results from the operator profit maximization model is
        analyzed. Finally, a numerical example from Changsha, China, is employed to
        verify the feasibility of the proposed model. The major results consist of
        optimized solutions for decision variables, i.e., the fares and train headways,
        as well as subsidies to the operator. The fare elasticity factor under two
        fare structures significantly affects fares and demand. As the fare elasticity
        factor increases, the social welfare gradually decreases and a deficit occurs
        at low fares and demand, while subsidies rise from 0 to \u00a524658.00 and
        \u00a538089.16 under the flat fare and distance-based fare structures.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6659384","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,26]],"date-time":"2021-01-26T04:50:09Z","timestamp":1611636609000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Profit

        is a complex and dynamic process. It is an essential goal to estimate latent
        attentional states based on behavioral measures in many sequences of behavioral
        tasks. Here, we propose a probabilistic modeling and inference framework for
        estimating the attentional state using simultaneous binary and continuous
        behavioral measures. The proposed model extends the standard hidden Markov
        model (HMM) by explicitly modeling the state duration distribution, which
        yields a special example of the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM). We validate
        our methods using computer simulations and experimental data. In computer
        simulations, we systematically investigate the impacts of model mismatch and
        the latency distribution. For the experimental data collected from a rodent
        visual detection task, we validate the results with predictive log-likelihood.
        Our work is useful for many behavioral neuroscience experiments, where the
        common goal is to infer the discrete (binary or multinomial) state sequences
        from multiple behavioral measures.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/493769","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,27]],"date-time":"2015-03-27T14:01:54Z","timestamp":1427464914000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Estimating

        paper applies a methodology that allows the fracture toughness of a given
        material to be estimated by testing notched fracture toughness specimens and
        applying the Theory of Critical Distances, which requires the elastic stress
        field at the notch tip to be determined by finite elements simulation. This
        methodology, which is not intended to substitute any standardised fracture
        characterisation procedure, constitutes an alternative in those situations
        where pre-cracking processes may be too time-consuming, too expensive or,
        simply, cannot be performed. It comprises testing two notched specimens with
        different notch radii, defining the corresponding stress fields at fracture
        by using finite elements analysis, and applying the Theory of Critical Distances
        in order to calibrate the material\u2019s critical distance and to apply the
        corresponding apparent fracture toughness formulation. The methodology has
        been applied to two different materials, PMMA and Al7075-T651, and the results
        have proven that, as long as the Theory of Critical Distances has been applied
        within its validity range, the fracture toughness estimations are highly accurate.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5402\/2012\/689386","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,9,17]],"date-time":"2012-09-17T21:31:08Z","timestamp":1347917468000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Estimation

        species of mycobacteria are known to use the host cholesterol during lung

        in minimal medium (MM) has been used as an<jats:italic>in vitro<\/jats:italic>experimental
        model to study the consumption of exogenous cholesterol. Once in MM, different
        species of mycobacteria start to consume the cholesterol and initiate transcriptional
        and metabolic adaptations, upregulating the enzymes of the methylcitrate cycle
        (MCC) and accumulating a variety of primary metabolites that are known to
        be important substrates for cell wall biosynthesis. We hypothesized that stressful
        pressure of cultures in MM is able to induce critical adaptation for the bacteria
        which win the infection. To identify important modifications in the biosynthesis
        of the cell wall, we cultured the fast-growing and nonpathogenic<jats:italic>Mycobacterium

        myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of hematological malignancy with diverse
        genetic pathogenesis. Identification of the miR-93-5p targeted pathogenic
        markers could be useful for AML diagnosis and potential therapy. We collected
        751 miR-93-5p targeted and AML-related genes by integrating the results of
        multiple databases and then used the expression profile of TCGA-LAML to construct
        a coexpression function network of AML WGCNA. Based on the clinical phenotype
        and module trait relationship, we identified two modules (brown and yellow)
        as interesting dysfunction modules, which have a significant association with
        cytogenetics risk and FAB classification systems. GO enrichment and KEGG analysis
        showed that these modules are mainly involved with cancer-associated pathways,
        including MAPK signal pathway, p53 signal pathway, JAK-STAT signal pathway,
        TGF-beta signaling pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, VEGF signaling pathway,
        both associated with the occurrence of AML. Besides, using the STRING database,
        we discovered the top 10 hub genes in each module, including MAPK1, ACTB,
        RAC1, GRB2, MDM2, ACTR2, IGF1R, CDKN1A, YWHAZ, and YWHAB in the brown module
        and VEGFA, FGF2, CCND1, FOXO3, IGFBP3, GSF1, IGF2, SLC2A4, PDGFBM, and PIK3R2
        in the yellow module. The prognosis analysis result showed that six key pathogens
        have significantly affected the overall survival and prognosis in AML. Interestingly,
        VEGF with the most significant regulatory relationship in the yellow modules
        significantly positively correlated with the clinical phenotype of AML. We
        used qPCR and ELISA to verify miR-93-5p and VEGF expression in our clinical
        samples. The results exhibited that miR-93-5p and VEGF were both highly expressed
        in AML.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5531736","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,20]],"date-time":"2021-03-20T21:05:08Z","timestamp":1616274308000},"page":"1-17","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Identification

        30-second all-out sprint cycling exercise is a classical sport capacity evaluation
        method, which may cause severe lower limb muscle fatigue. However, the relationship
        between lower limb muscle fatigue and the decline in exercise performance
        during 30-second sprint cycling remains unclear. In this study, ten cyclists
        volunteered to participate in a 30-second all-out sprint cycling while power,
        cadence, and surface electromyographic (EMG) signals of eight lower limb muscles
        were recorded during the exercise. EMG mean frequency (MNF) of each lower
        limb muscle group was computed for every 3-second epoch based on wavelet packet
        transformation. Grey relational grades between pedalling performance and the
        EMG MNF of each lower limb muscle group during the whole process were calculated.
        The results demonstrated that EMG MNF of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus (VAS),
        gastrocnemius (GAS), and tibialis anterior (TA) progressively tired during
        a 30-second all-out sprint cycling exercise. Of the muscles evaluated, the
        degree of fatigue of TA showed the greatest association with exercise performance
        decline, whereas the muscle fatigue of RF, VAS, and GAS also significantly
        impacted exercise performance during a 30-second all-out sprint cycling exercise.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6755767","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,14]],"date-time":"2021-12-14T03:05:09Z","timestamp":1639451109000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Grey

        the past decades, there have existed extensive research works on the designs
        of the closest pre-tender procurement bidding. However, most solutions for
        the closest pre-tender only target at economic benefits while omitting the
        problem of bid privacy leakage. Moreover, existing works fail to provide approaches
        with adequate security and high efficiency. In this paper, for the first time,
        we propose SPCTR, a sealed-price auction-based procurement bidding system
        for the closest pre-tender with range validation. SPCTR allows a range validation
        for a supplier\u2019s bid without leaking the secret bid. Besides, SPCTR achieves
        a sealed-price comparison with the pre-tender to find the closest pre-tender
        bid. Compared with previous works, SPCTR provides strong privacy protection
        for the bids of suppliers without sacrificing high efficiency. SPCTR is constructed
        based on carefully designed cryptographic tools with generality and simplicity
        which enable various operations on the encrypted values, and these tools can
        be easily applied to other contexts. We not only formally prove that SPCTR
        is secure against semihonest adversaries but also comprehensively analyze
        the efficiency. Experimental results validate that SPCTR achieves procurement
        bidding with light computation time and communication cost in practice.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/8872617","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,25]],"date-time":"2020-08-25T23:32:55Z","timestamp":1598398375000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["SPCTR:

        simulate the optical and electrical responses in gallium-doped graphene. Using
        density functional theory with a local density approximation, we simulate
        the electronic band structure and show the effects of impurity doping (0\u20133.91%)
        in graphene on the electron density, refractive index, optical conductivity,
        and extinction coefficient for each doping percentage. Here, gallium atoms
        are placed randomly (using a 5-point average) throughout a 128-atom sheet
        of graphene. These calculations demonstrate the effects of hole doping due
        to direct atomic substitution, where it is found that a disruption in the
        electronic structure and electron density for small doping levels is due to
        impurity scattering of the electrons. However, the system continues to produce
        metallic or semimetallic behavior with increasing doping levels. These calculations
        are compared to a purely theoretical 100% Ga sheet for comparison of conductivity.
        Furthermore, we examine the change in the electronic band structure, where
        the introduction of gallium electronic bands produces a shift in the electron
        bands and dissolves the characteristic Dirac cone within graphene, which leads
        to better electron mobility.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/635019","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,13]],"date-time":"2015-08-13T21:03:31Z","timestamp":1439499811000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Computational

        genus is the bacteria responsible for campylobacteriosis infections, and it
        is the commonest cause of gastroenteritis in adults and infants. The disease
        is hyperendemic in children in most parts of developing countries. It is a
        zoonotic disease that can be contracted via direct contact, food, and water.
        In this paper, we formulated a deterministic model for Campylobacteriosis
        as a zoonotic disease with optimal control and to determine the best control
        measure. The nonstandard finite difference scheme was used for the model analysis.
        The disease-free equilibrium of the scheme in its explicit form was determined,
        and it was shown to be both locally and globally asymptotically stable. The
        campylobacteriosis model was extended to optimal control using prevention
        of susceptible humans contracting the disease and treatment of infected humans
        and animals. The objective function was optimised, and it was established
        that combining prevention of susceptible humans and treatment of infected
        animals was the effective control measure in combating campylobacteriosis
        infections. An analysis of the effects of contact between susceptible and
        infected animals as well susceptible and infected humans was conducted. It
        showed an increase in infected animals and humans whenever the contact rate
        increases and decreases otherwise. Biologically, it implies that campylobacteriosis
        infections can be controlled by ensuring that interactions among susceptible
        humans, infected animals, and infected humans is reduced to the barest minimum.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/8843299","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]],"date-time":"2020-11-19T12:57:32Z","timestamp":1605790652000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Modelling

        The pneumonia severity index (PSI) accounts for many comorbidities, but not
        immunosuppression.<\/jats:p><jats:p>OBJECTIVES: To document the utility of
        the PSI to predict mortality in immunocompromised patients (IP) with community-acquired
        pneumonia (CAP).<\/jats:p><jats:p>METHODS: Charts of 284 patients with immunosuppression
        and CAP were reviewed, and these patients were compared with a contemporary
        sample of non-IP with CAP. The ability of the PSI to predict mortality was
        assessed by using multiple logistic regression. Discrimination of the PSI
        was studied by using the concordance index.<\/jats:p><jats:p>RESULTS: Thirty-nine
        of 284 IP died. Mortality varied according to the etiology of the immunosuppression.
        Patients with HIV, solid organ transplantation or treatment with immunosuppressive
        drugs (n=118) had a low in-hospital mortality (4.3%) and were classified as
        low risk. IP with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy, chest radiation
        or marrow transplantation (n=166) had a high mortality (20%) and were classified
        as high risk. Compared with non-IP, low-risk IP had similar PSI-controlled
        mortality (OR=0.9, P=0.80), whereas high-risk IP had significantly greater
        mortality (OR=2.8, P&lt;0.0001). The concordance index revealed similar discrimination
        for the PSI in low-risk IP (0.77) and in non-IP (0.7), but inferior discrimination
        in high-risk patients (0.6).<\/jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CAP
        and immunosuppression can be divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The
        low-risk IP have mortality similar to non-IP and can be risk stratified by
        using the PSI.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2006\/195464","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2016,3,15]],"date-time":"2016-03-15T07:50:56Z","timestamp":1458028256000},"page":"89-93","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":25,"title":["Pneumonia

        the necessary condition for the divergence-free property of the magnetic induction
        field in the whole space, known as solenoidality condition, directly comes
        from the conservation of total momentum for the system, that is, sources and
        field. This work, in general, leads to results that leave some open questions
        on the existence, or at least the observability, of magnetic monopoles, theoretically

        were enrolled. TBNA and conventional diagnostic techniques (CDTs: forceps
        biopsy, brushing, and washing) were performed in all patients. Endobronchial
        lesions were classified into exophytic mass lesions (EMLs), submucosal disease
        (SD), and peribronchial disease (PD). The diagnostic yields of TBNA and CDT
        alone and together were compared according to the lesions\u2019 types, histopathology,
        and locations. During 3-year period, the addition of TBNA to CDT improved
        bronchoscopic sensitivity from 70.2% to 94.7% in all lesion types. Addition
        of TBNA to CDT increased the diagnostic success from 74% to 95% and from 50%

        in all localizations by the addition of TBNA to CDT, particularly for lesions

        addition of TBNA to CDT increases the diagnostic yield in patients with visible

        vehicle has gained increasing attention due to its high cruise speed and long
        voyage. In this paper, an enhanced Sequential Approximate Optimization method
        is proposed for aerodynamic optimization of a hypersonic vehicle. In this
        method, a constrained design of experiment method is adopted to generate the
        initial sampling set with adequate number of feasible points. A field metamodel
        is proposed to surrogate the aerodynamic parameters distributions in the flow
        field obtained by the aerodynamic simulation. A hybrid metamodel combing radial
        basis functions and polynomial chaos expansion is applied to construct the
        field metamodel with good approximate performance. A robust mesh morphing
        scheme based on radial basis functions is developed to generate high-quality
        meshes for the sequential optimization scheme. The hypersonic vehicle aerodynamic
        optimization problem is performed using the proposed optimization framework
        and satisfactory results are obtained with limited computational budgets.
        Results show that the proposed field metamodel-enhanced Sequential Approximate
        Optimization method possesses powerful optimization performance and promising
        prospects in the field of hypersonic vehicle optimization design.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8889593","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]],"date-time":"2021-03-17T14:50:09Z","timestamp":1615992609000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Hypersonic

        A tag library was created using the LongSAGE method and consisted of 14,208

        sequences of genes, while 82% (1,349\/1,645) identified one or more genomic

        Sorafenib is an anticancer drug used in the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular
        carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. It is a substrate for the human
        OATP1B1. This study is aimed at assessing the role of OATP1B1 in transportation
        and uptake of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma and how OATP1B1 affects
        the pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. Methods. Sorafenib

        cells, as well as in HepG2 cells transfected with miR-148a mimics. The viability
        and apoptosis rate of cells treated with sorafenib were evaluated. A liver
        cancer rat model was established to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
        of sorafenib after overexpression of Oatp2. Results. Changes in expression
        and genetic mutations of OATP1B1 significantly affected the uptake of sorafenib
        in HepG2 and LO2 transgenic cells, and the uptake of sorafenib was higher
        in HepG2 than LO2. Genetic mutations of OATP1B1 significantly affected the
        cell viability and apoptosis rate of HepG2 cells after sorafenib treatment.
        Compared to control group, the uptake of sorafenib in miR-148a mimic-transfected
        HepG2 cells was decreased, and the cell viability was increased. PCN significantly
        increased the expression of Oatp2 and affected the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib.
        Vascular endothelial growth factor levels and microvascular density in tumor-adjacent
        tissues decreased significantly, suggesting that increased Oatp2 expression
        improves the treatment effect of sorafenib in a rat model of liver cancer.
        Conclusions. OATP1B1 plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics
        of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/9711179","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,26]],"date-time":"2021-09-26T19:09:39Z","timestamp":1632683379000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["OATP1B1

        in area, and has a summit depth of 1260\u2009m. The sea bottom water temperature
        is . The gas hydrate crystals generally have the form of flakes or rice, some
        larger aggregates of them are up to 2\u2009cm across. A pressure core taken
        at the site contained 3.1 lt. of hydrocarbon gases composed of methane, nearly
        devoid of propane and butane. The sediment had a gas hydrate occupancy of
        0.7% of the core volume. These characteristics place the gas hydrate field
        at Thessaloniki MV at the upper boundary of the gas hydrate stability zone,

        Orc1\/Cdc6 is involved in nuclear DNA replication, and, despite its involvement
        in such a conserved process, Orc1\/Cdc6 is distinct from mammalian Orc1 and

        mathematical model is proposed and analysed to study the dynamics of two-prey
        one predator system of fishery model with Holling type II function response.
        The effect of harvesting was incorporated to both populations and thoroughly
        analysed. We study the ecological dynamics of the Nile perch, cichlid, and
        tilapia fishes as prey-predator system of lake Victoria fishery in Tanzania.
        In both cases, by nondimensionalization of the system, the equilibrium points
        are computed and conditions for local and global stability of the system are
        obtained. Condition for local stability was obtained by eigenvalue approach
        and Routh-Hurwitz Criterion. Moreover, the global stability of the coexistence
        equilibrium point is proved by defining appropriate Lyapunov function. Bioeconomic
        equilibrium is analysed and numerical simulations are also carried out to
        verify the analytical results. The numerical results indicate that the three
        species would coexist if cichlid and tilapia fishes will not be overharvested
        as these populations contribute to the growth rates of Nile perch population.
        The fishery control management should be exercised to avoid overharvesting
        of cichlid and tilapia fishes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/2601648","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,2]],"date-time":"2019-06-02T23:32:12Z","timestamp":1559518332000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Modeling

        recent years, amounts of permutation-diffusion architecture-based image cryptosystems
        have been proposed. However, the key stream elements in the diffusion procedure
        are merely depending on the secret key that is usually fixed during the whole
        encryption process. Cryptosystems of this type suffer from unsatisfactory
        encryption speed and are considered insecure upon known\/chosen plaintext
        attacks. In this paper, an efficient diffusion scheme is proposed. This scheme
        consists of two diffusion procedures, with a supplementary diffusion procedure
        padded after the normal diffusion. In the supplementary diffusion module,
        the control parameter of the selected chaotic map is altered by the resultant
        image produced after the normal diffusion operation. As a result, a slight
        difference in the plain image can be transferred to the chaotic iteration
        and bring about distinct key streams, and hence totally different cipher images
        will be produced. Therefore, the scheme can remarkably accelerate the diffusion
        effect of the cryptosystem and will effectively resist known\/chosen plaintext
        attacks. Theoretical analyses and experimental results prove the high security
        performance and satisfactory operation efficiency of the proposed scheme.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/427349","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,31]],"date-time":"2014-03-31T21:16:43Z","timestamp":1396300603000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["An

        years have witnessed renewed interest in developing skin segmentation approaches.
        Skin feature segmentation has been widely employed in different aspects of
        computer vision applications including face detection and hand gestures recognition
        systems. This is mostly due to the attractive characteristics of skin colour
        and its effectiveness to object segmentation. On the contrary, there are certain
        challenges in using human skin colour as a feature to segment dynamic hand
        gesture, due to various illumination conditions, complicated environment,
        and computation time or real-time method. These challenges have led to the
        insufficiency of many of the skin color segmentation approaches. Therefore,
        to produce simple, effective, and cost efficient skin segmentation, this paper
        has proposed a skin segmentation scheme. This scheme includes two procedures
        for calculating generic threshold ranges in Cb-Cr colour space. The first
        procedure uses threshold values trained online from nose pixels of the face
        region. Meanwhile, the second procedure known as the offline training procedure
        uses thresholds trained out of skin samples and weighted equation. The experimental
        results showed that the proposed scheme achieved good performance in terms
        of efficiency and computation time.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2017\/7645189","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2017,3,2]],"date-time":"2017-03-02T21:00:44Z","timestamp":1488488444000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Low

        Background Several studies have shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) and oxidised
        low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) are critical factors in atherosclerosis.
        In this study, we examined the molecular basis of mutually facilitative interactions
        between Ang II and ox-LDL in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).
        <\/jats:p><jats:p> Methods and results We observed that incubation of cultured
        HCAECs with Ang II (10-12 to 10-6 M) for 24 hours caused a concentration-dependent
        increase in the expression of mRNA and protein of a specialised receptor for
        ox-LDL (LOX-1). These effects of Ang II were completely blocked by pretreatment
        of HCAECs with candesartan (10-6 M), a specific AT1-receptor blocker, but
        not by PD 123319 (10-6 M), a specific AT2-receptor blocker. On the other hand,
        incubation of HCAECs with ox-LDL (10 and 40 \u00b5g\/ml) for 24 hours progressively
        upregulated AT1-, but not AT 2-, receptor mRNA and protein. Pretreatment of
        cells with the anti-oxidant alpha-tocopherol (1\u20145 x 10-6 M) inhibited
        the upregulation of AT1-receptor expression induced by ox-LDL (p&lt;0.05).
        To determine the significance of expression of AT1-receptors and LOX-1, we
        measured cell injury in response to Ang II and ox-LDL. Incubation of cells
        with both ox-LDL and Ang II synergistically increased cell injury, measured
        as cell viability and LDH release, compared with either ox-LDL or Ang II alone
        (both p&lt;0.05). Alpha-tocopherol, as well as candesartan, attenuated cell
        injury in response to Ang II and ox-LDL (both p&lt;0.05). <\/jats:p><jats:p>
        Conclusions These observations show that Ang II upregulates a novel endothelial
        receptor for ox-LDL (LOX-1) gene expression and ox-LDL in turn upregulates
        Ang II AT 1receptor gene expression. This interaction between Ang II and ox-LDL
        further augments cell injury in HCAECs. These findings provide basis for the
        use of AT1-receptor blockers and anti-oxidants in designing therapy for atherosclerosis
        and myocardial ischaemia. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/14703203010020011201","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,30]],"date-time":"2010-09-30T13:43:59Z","timestamp":1285854239000},"page":"S70-S76","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Facilitative

        concentration, adsorbent dose, ionic strength, pH, and temperature. Langmuir
        and Freundlich isotherm models were applied to the equilibrium data. The data
        fitted well with the Langmuir isotherm (). The maximum monolayer adsorption
        capacity () was found to be 20.96\u2009mg\/g at an initial pH of 7.2. The
        temperature variation study showed that dye adsorption is exothermic and spontaneous
        with increased randomness at the solid solution interface. The results indicated
        that sugarcane stalks could be an alternative for more costly adsorbents used
        for dye removal. The kinetic of the adsorption process followed the pseudo

        photoelectrochemical response and catalytic efficiency towards phenol photooxidation
        of mesoporous titania particles with spherical morphology have been explored.
        The catalysts were synthesized in two different arrangements using carbon
        spheres in a dual role as support and morphology director: hollow spherical
        titania particles and dense structures where the titania shell is surrounding
        a carbon core. Although the synthesized titania hollow spheres exhibited a
        similar photoelectrochemical behavior and optical properties than commercial
        P25, they showed a better photocatalytic response towards phenol photo-oxidation
        in terms of pollutant mineralization. This behavior cannot be explained in
        terms of the crystallinity (found to be higher for P25) and has been attributed
        to both confinement effects in the mesoporosity of these catalysts as well
        as to the spherical morphology of titania particles. The spherical arrangement
        of the titania surface would favor the fast motion of the charge carriers
        and minimize recombination processes. On the other hand, no clear contribution
        of the carbon phase to the enhanced photocatalytic response, since quite similar
        performance is observed for the hollow spheres and the core\/shell composite.
        However, separation and filtration of the catalysts become easier for the
        carbon\/titania composite, thereby improving the so-called practical efficiency.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2013\/178512","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,11,26]],"date-time":"2012-11-26T21:07:54Z","timestamp":1353964074000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Tuning

        To explore the influencing factors of medication compliance in patients with
        recurrent vertebral fractures after percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) and the
        role of family-centered education intervention. Methods. From January 2018
        to January 2021, the general disease-related data survey form and medication
        compliance questionnaire made by our hospital were used to evaluate the scores
        of 198 patients with recurrent vertebral fractures after PKP in the Department
        of Orthopedics of our hospital. Single-factor and multiple linear regression
        analyses were used to explore the influencing factors of medication compliance
        in patients with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP. From 198 patients,
        80 eligible patients were selected for further research. According to a random
        number table method, they were divided into the control group (n\u2009=\u200940)
        given only antiosteoporosis drug treatment and care and the experimental group
        (n\u2009=\u200940) combined with family-centered education intervention. After
        12 months of intervention, the two groups were evaluated for their knowledge
        of osteoporosis, medication compliance, and physical health. Results. Of the
        198 patients, only 65 had good medication compliance, 90 had poor medication
        compliance, and 43 were acceptable. Univariate analysis showed that the influencing
        factors of medication compliance in patients with recurrent vertebral fractures
        after PKP include the patient\u2019s education, living style, per capita monthly
        income, combined other diseases, number of hospitalizations, and time since
        the last hospitalization (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        Multiple linear regression analysis showed that patients with recurring vertebral
        fractures after PKP with high education, living with spouse or children, combined
        with other diseases, frequent hospitalizations, and short time from the last
        hospitalization had higher medication compliance (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        After the intervention, the disease knowledge mastery of the experimental
        group was significantly better than before and after the intervention in the
        control group (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        After the intervention, the medication compliance and health status of the
        experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group
        (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M4\">\n                        <mi>P<\/mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;<\/mo>\n                        <mn>0.05<\/mn>\n                     <\/math>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula>).
        Conclusion. The medication compliance of patients with recurrent vertebral
        fractures after PKP is generally poor, and medical staff need to take targeted
        interventions based on the main factors that affect the patients\u2019 medication
        compliance. Family-centered education intervention is an effective way to
        improve disease awareness, medication compliance, and health status of patients
        with recurring vertebral fractures after PKP.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3974674","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,22]],"date-time":"2021-10-22T22:13:09Z","timestamp":1634940789000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Analysis

        study assesses the impacts of wave action and freshwater outflow on soft-bottom
        benthic macrofauna spatial distribution and temporal stability along the highly
        exposed French Basque coast. Sediment characteristics and macrofauna abundance
        have been seasonally investigated during two years for nine stations located
        at the same (6\u2009m) depth and spread over three subtidal sites showing
        distinct exposure levels. Wave climate has been determined through an operational
        numerical model. A total of 121 taxa were recorded, gathered in three main
        faunal assemblages, as revealed by classification and ordination methods.
        Non-parametric multivariate multiple regression (distance-based linear model)
        showed that the variations in macrofaunal distribution can be explained by
        hydrodynamic conditions. Wave exposure strongly linked to estuarine inputs
        were the most relevant abiotic factors influencing distributional patterns
        and functional structure as described by biological traits analysis. Despite
        the influence of these abiotic variables affecting sedimentary dynamics, seasonal
        stability was observed in macrobenthic assemblages composition suggesting
        an ability to recover from natural disturbances such as (e.g.) winter storms.
        In this way, these results provide baseline knowledge for future ecosystem
        and resource management in shallow subtidal areas strongly exposed to swell
        and freshwater outflow where soft-bottom macrozoobenthic communities are less
        frequently studied.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/4674580","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,30]],"date-time":"2020-01-30T23:31:13Z","timestamp":1580427073000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Hydrodynamic

        paper investigates the effect of a change in life expectancy (i.e., longevity)
        on fertility in a standard OLG economy. The main result is that, in contrast
        with other papers, an increase in the longevity rate may increase the fertility
        rate as well. It is shown that such a result holds when the cost of rearing
        children in terms of goods and services (rather than in terms of forgone wages)
        matters. In particular, such a result depends on the relative \u201cstrength\u201d
        of the capital in the technology as compared with the \u201cstrength\u201d
        of the parsimony. Moreover it is shown, again in contrast with other papers,
        that with an unfunded social security system it is more likely that a longer
        life may increase the fertility. The latter result is even more likely in
        the presence of child subsidy policies, which are widespread in developed
        countries. In conclusion, we argue that in countries having a population with
        a high longevity, a high capital share, a large unfunded social security,
        and child subsidy policies (such as Italy), a further increase of longevity
        may increase fertility in the long run and thus partially alleviate the peril

        the rapid development of computer technology, people have begun to combine
        virtual reality and other technologies to achieve scientific sports auxiliary
        training, to get rid of the state of traditional sports training purely relying
        on experience. The article proposes a deep learning BP neural network human
        body posture recognition algorithm and briefly introduces the human body motion
        posture. The purpose of this research was to use the powerful data processing,
        mining, and analysis functions of deep learning to train the massive data
        generated in competitive sports training and apply it to competitive sports
        training. It is committed to promoting the accuracy and analysis of competitive
        sports training. Refinement provides technical guidance for athletes\u2019
        training, promotes the scientific and informatized development of competitive
        sports training in China, and provides some reference methods for the research
        and application of deep learning in competitive sports training. The article\u2019s
        research results show that (1) taking a rural area as an example, we recorded
        the exercise postures of rural athletes in five different states: static,
        upstairs, downstairs, walking, and running. Comparing the recognition rate
        and training time of The BP neural network algorithm, ABC-BP algorithm, AFS-BP
        algorithm, and ABC-AFS-BP algorithm, it can be found that in terms of recognition
        rate, ABC-AFS-BP algorithm, AFS-BP algorithm, and ABC-BP algorithm are better
        than traditional BP algorithm. Among them, the recognition rate of the ABC-AFS-BP
        algorithm is higher than that of the ABC-BP algorithm, but it takes slightly
        more time than the ABC-BP algorithm. In terms of training time, the ABC-BP
        algorithm takes less time, but the accuracy is lower than the ABC-AFS-BP algorithm;
        the ABC-AFS-BP algorithm has a greater improvement in time consumption than
        the AFS-BP model and can guarantee the recognition rate and accuracy, and
        the error rate curves of the four algorithms show that after 500 iterations
        of the training part, the iteration error value of the ABC-AFS-BP algorithm
        is the smallest. (2) We evaluated sports postures of athletes from a certain
        rural team and concluded that bad postures will have a certain impact on the
        body. Among them, more than 85% of athletes in football and basketball have
        pelvic rotation. The problem is that football players have reached 90% of
        the test sample. 60% of football players and basketball players have the problem
        of collapsed foot. The main problem of aerobic athletes is flat back and collapsed
        foot. More than 90% of badminton players have high and low shoulder problems,
        and more than 80% of them have neck problems, which is a very serious body
        posture problem. (3) Detecting the flexibility experiment of the BP posture
        detection algorithm, compared with the traditional motion posture recording
        method, we tested from the three aspects of recording motion accuracy, missed
        detection rate, and recording time. The result shows BP posture detection.
        The missing detection rate of the algorithm is low, basically maintained at
        about 2.0, the accuracy of recording actions is relatively high, generally
        maintained above 98%, and the highest is 99.15%, and the recording time is
        short, maintained at 3\u20134\u2009minutes; comparing traditional posture
        detection with the BP attitude detection algorithm, the missed detection rate
        of the algorithm is relatively high, kept at 4\u20136, the action accuracy
        is lower than that of the BP attitude detection algorithm, generally kept
        at about 95%, and the recording time is kept at 5\u20136\u2009minutes. The
        posture detection algorithm is more efficient.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/5916301","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,4]],"date-time":"2022-03-04T21:05:06Z","timestamp":1646427906000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Research

        helium burning phase represents the second stage that the star used to consume
        nuclear fuel in its interior. In this stage, the three elements, carbon, oxygen,
        and neon, are synthesized. The present paper is twofold: firstly, it develops
        an analytical solution to the system of the conformable fractional differential
        equations of the helium burning network, where we used, for this purpose,
        the series expansion method and obtained recurrence relations for the product
        abundances, that is, helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon. Using four different
        initial abundances, we calculated 44 gas models covering the range of the
        fractional parameter<jats:inline-formula><math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        We found that the effects of the fractional parameter on the product abundances
        are small which coincides with the results obtained by a previous study. Secondly,
        we introduced the mathematical model of the neural network (NN) and developed
        a neural network algorithm to simulate the helium burning network using a
        feed-forward process. A comparison between the NN and the analytical models
        revealed very good agreement for all gas models. We found that NN could be
        considered as a powerful tool to solve and model nuclear burning networks
        and could be applied to the other nuclear stellar burning networks.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6662217","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]],"date-time":"2021-03-17T00:05:29Z","timestamp":1615939529000},"page":"1-18","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Conformable

        research was aimed to study CT image features based on the backprojection
        filtering reconstruction algorithm and evaluate the effect of ropivacaine
        combined with dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine on assisted thoracoscopic
        lobectomy to provide reference for clinical diagnosis. A total of 110 patients
        undergoing laparoscopic resection were selected as the study subjects. Anesthesia
        induction and nerve block were performed with ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone
        and dexmedetomidine before surgery, and chest CT scan was performed. The backprojection
        image reconstruction algorithm was constructed and applied to patient CT images
        for reconstruction processing. The results showed that when the overlapping
        step size was 16 and the block size was 32\u2009\u00d7\u200932, the running
        time of the algorithm was the shortest. The resolution and sharpness of reconstructed
        images were better than the Fourier transform analytical method and iterative
        reconstruction algorithm. The detection rates of lung nodules smaller than
        6\u2009mm and 6\u201330\u2009mm (92.35% and 95.44%) were significantly higher
        than those of the Fourier transform analytical method and iterative reconstruction
        algorithm (90.98% and 87.53%; 88.32% and 90.87%) (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        After anesthesia induction and lobectomy with ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone

        after five days. In summary, ropivacaine combined with dexamethasone and dexmedetomidine
        had better sedation and analgesia effects in patients with thoracoscopic lobectomy.

        and water-to-cement ratio have significant influences on rheology of cement
        grouts. In order to study effects of time and water-to-cement ratio on rheology
        of Bingham cement grouts, taking Bingham cement grouts widely used in practical
        engineering (cement grouts with water-to-cement ratio of 0.75\u20131.25) as
        research object, some rheological experiments of five cement grouts with water-to-cement
        ratio of 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, and 1.25 were carried out at six moments of 0,
        5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. Combining theoretical discussion
        with numerical analysis, influence of coupling effects of time and water-to-cement
        ratio on rheological properties of Bingham cement grouts was discussed. Results
        show that at the level of \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.05, time has a significant
        influence on plastic viscosity but has no significant influence on the yield
        stress of Bingham cement grouts. Water-to-cement ratio has a significant influence
        on both plastic viscosity and yield stress. Exponential models obtained by
        comprehensive analysis from statistical theory, practical applicability, and
        accuracy are the optimal models to describe quantitative change in the relationship
        of coupling effects of time and water-to-cement ratio on plastic viscosity
        and yield stress of Bingham cement grouts. The rheological equation considering
        coupling effects of time and water-to-cement ratio of Bingham cement grouts
        is constructed. Research achievements not only have certain theoretical significance
        to the development and improvement of fluid mechanics and theoretical system
        of penetration grouting but also provide theoretical support and technical
        reference for practical grouting engineering and also have certain practical
        significance for solving or improving the practical engineering problems.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5781753","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,23]],"date-time":"2021-10-23T19:20:09Z","timestamp":1635016809000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Influence

        In all, 6044 patients were recruited and provided with a questionnaire about

        proposed based on the shear fatigue damage accumulation at the coating-substrate
        interface. The life of a small-caliber gun barrel is predicted by use of constant
        tensile strength at normal temperature and temperature-dependent tensile strength,

        that the reduction of interface tensile strength due to temperature rise in
        the firing process is an important inducement of interface damage and gun
        barrel failure. When the temperature-dependent tensile strength is considered
        in life prediction model, the prediction results are smaller than that predicted
        by use of constant tensile strength and well matched with the life test results.

        systems for site-selective RNA scission have been prepared by combining Lu(III)

        order to improve the security and robustness of the Information Steganography
        Algorithm under strictly controlled environment, a new algorithm of modification-free
        steganography based on image and big data is introduced in this paper. In
        the proposed algorithm, a mapping relationship between the hot image entropy
        and the secret information is constructed and the payload information is expressed
        by the mapping relation. At the same time, turbo code is introduced in order
        to improve robustness, the hot image comes from Internet image big data, and
        the library of hot image is established. The performance of the proposed algorithm
        is analyzed using simulation experiment. Because of its none-modifying on
        carrier image, the results of experiment show that the proposed algorithm
        can achieve good performance in robustness analysis, dimension scaling attack,
        and rotation attack. In particular, in the test of dimension scaling attack
        and the rotation attack, the rate of data recovering can be over 95%. The
        proposed algorithm can be very valuable in the covert communication which
        requires high security and low volume, for example, the key exchange of symmetric
        encryption system.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/6256872","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,26]],"date-time":"2018-03-26T19:31:26Z","timestamp":1522092686000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["A

        simply supported composite trusses with different configurations of shear
        connection (<jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>) were evaluated via three-point
        bending tests. The effects of the shear connectors\u2019 configuration on
        the flexural response (i.e., load-deflection, load-slippage, and load-strain
        curves) of the composite trusses were examined. The commercial finite-element
        (FE) software ANSYS was employed to conduct numerical simulations. An FE model
        was developed for the composite truss and was validated using experimental
        results. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effect of the
        shear connectors\u2019 configuration on the flexural response of the composite
        trusses. If <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>\u2009&lt;\u20091, the bending
        capacity increased with <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>. In contrast, if
        <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>\u2009\u2265\u20091, the effect of <jats:italic>\u03b7<\/jats:italic>
        on the bending capacity was negligible. Finally, a design method based on
        the degree of the shear connection was proposed to predict the ultimate capacity
        of the composite truss, and the predictions agreed well with the experimental
        results.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/1502707","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,12]],"date-time":"2019-06-12T19:30:34Z","timestamp":1560367834000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Flexural

        the field of modern manufacturing, probes have been playing a more and more
        crucial role. However, contact probes are unfit for measuring objects with
        soft surfaces or very tiny cavities and require radius compensation of stylus.
        In comparison, noncontact probes such as optical probes do not have to consider
        these problems and are well-performed in measurement. However, existing optical
        probes (triangulation) may fail to detect objects with rich spatial structures
        (due to the occlusion effect) and highly reflective curved surfaces (due to
        existence of highlight spots). Considering the problems, an optical probe
        based on discrete rotational symmetric triangulation is proposed in this paper.
        The emitting laser beam of the probe is the rotational axis and the five receiving
        optical paths (lenses and mirrors) are rotationally symmetrically distributed
        around the laser axis and are coimaged on a CMOS camera. Results of simulations
        and experiments show that the new-established prototype is designed with good
        robustness under various conditions such as different surface characteristics
        and different inclination degrees. The probe enables conducting real-time
        on-machine measurement without directional dependency with a resolution of

        secretory function of airway epithelial cells is important in the pathogenesis

        of NKILA (nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) interacting long noncoding RNA
        (lncRNA)) in MPP, we first detected NKILA as well as the concentration of
        interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in bronchoalveolar
        lavage fluid of children with MPP. Then, NKILA was knocked down in epithelial
        cells to investigate its effect on their secretory function. The results suggested
        that NKILA was downregulated in children with MPP, while IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1
        levels increased. Knockdown of NKILA in vitro promoted the inflammatory effects
        of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) in epithelial A549 and BEAS-2B cells. Knockdown
        of NKILA promoted inhibitor of \u03baB\u03b1 (I\u03baB\u03b1) phosphorylation
        and degradation, and NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, RNA
        immunoprecipitation showed that NKILA could physically bind to I\u03baB\u03b1
        in MP-treated A549 cells. Collectively, our data demonstrated that attenuation

        new flexible microwave tag system using a frequency-scanning type RFID is
        proposed with multiple resonators based on defected ground structures (DGSs).
        The proposed system achieves fully passive tag systems using multiple resonators
        with a spiral-shaped DGS over a wide frequency range. The resonator implemented
        on the rear side of a transmission line has the advantages of excellent band
        notch characteristics as well as bit-error avoidance from the frequency selective
        reflection. In addition, the tag system is designed on a thin flexible substrate
        in order to be applicable for amorphous surfaces. The proposed microwave tags
        have been implemented with wideband antennas at 3\u20137\u2009GHz on thick
        and thin flexible substrates. The flexibility of the thin substrate has been
        evaluated in terms of cognitive capability for various radiuses of curvatures.
        From the experimental results in an anechoic chamber, the excellent recognition
        of various multibits identification codes in a wireless transmission environment
        has been verified.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2013\/415607","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,4]],"date-time":"2013-06-04T21:03:06Z","timestamp":1370379786000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Flexible

        life adversity increases the risk of mental disorders later in life. Chronic
        early life stress may alter neurotrophic factor gene expression including
        those for brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell derived
        neurotrophic factor (GDNF) that are important in neuronal growth, survival,
        and maintenance. Maternal separation was used in this study to model early
        life stress. Following unilateral injection of a mild dose of 6-hydroxydopamine
        (6-OHDA), we measured corticosterone (CORT) in the blood and striatum of stressed
        and nonstressed rats; we also measured DNA methylation and BDNF and GDNF gene
        expression in the striatum using real time PCR. In the presence of stress,
        we found that there was increased corticosterone concentration in both blood
        and striatal tissue. Further to this, we found higher DNA methylation and
        decreased neurotrophic factor gene expression. 6-OHDA lesion increased neurotrophic
        factor gene expression in both stressed and nonstressed rats but this increase
        was higher in the nonstressed rats. Our results suggest that exposure to early
        postnatal stress increases corticosterone concentration which leads to increased
        DNA methylation. This effect results in decreased BDNF and GDNF gene expression
        in the striatum leading to decreased protection against subsequent insults

        Clear cell basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is an uncommon and unusual variant of
        BCC, which is characterized by a variable component of clear cells. The pathogenesis
        of this histological variant and its clinical significance has not been clarified.  Differentiation
        of this uncommon variant of BCC from other clear cell tumors is important
        for the treatment. \n<jats:italic>Case Presentation<\/jats:italic>. A 65-year-old
        male presented with a 0.9\u2009cm dome-shaped lesion on his upper chest.  A
        shave biopsy revealed a dermal basaloid tumor that comprised nests with a
        peripheral palisading pattern, retraction artifacts, and striking clear cell
        changes.  Histopathologic examination, along with findings from immunohistochemical
        studies and special staining of the clear cells, supports the diagnosis of
        clear cell basal cell carcinoma. \n<jats:italic>Conclusion<\/jats:italic>.
        Clear cell BCC is a rare and unusual variant of BCC.  The underlying pathogenesis

        disease animal models are absolutely invaluable tools for our understanding
        of mechanisms involved in both physiological and pathological processes. By
        studying various genetic abnormalities in these organisms we can get a better
        insight into potential candidate genes responsible for human disease development.
        To this point a mouse represents one of the most used and convenient species
        for human disease modeling. Hundreds if not thousands of inbred, congenic,
        and transgenic mouse models have been created and are now extensively utilized
        in the research labs worldwide. Importantly, pluripotent stem cells play a
        significant role in developing new genetically engineered mice with the desired
        human disease-like phenotype. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells which represent
        reprogramming of somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells represent a significant

        disease (KD) is an acute systemic vasculitis of childhood with prolonged fever,
        and the diagnosis of KD is mainly based on clinical criteria, which is prone
        to misdiagnosis with other febrile infectious (FI) diseases. Currently, there
        remain no effective molecular markers for KD diagnosis. In this study, we
        aimed to use a relative-expression-based method k-TSP and resampling framework
        to identify robust gene pair signatures to distinguish KD from bacterial and
        virus febrile infectious diseases. Our study pool consisted of 808 childhood
        patients from several studies and assigned to three groups, namely, the discovery
        set (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>=<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>224<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>),
        validation set-1 (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M2\"><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>=<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>197<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>),
        and validation set-2 (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M3\"><mml:mi>n<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>=<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>387<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>).
        We had identified 60 biologically relevant gene pairs and developed a top-ranked
        gene pair classifier (TRGP) using the first seven signatures, with the area
        under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUROC) of 0.947 (95% CI,
        0.918-0.976), a sensitivity of 0.936 (95% CI, 0.872-0.987), and a specificity
        of 0.774 (95% CI, 0.705-0.836) in the discovery set. In the validation set-1,
        the TRGP classifier distinguished KD from FI with AUROC of 0.955 (95% CI,
        0.919-0.991), a sensitivity of 0.959 (95% CI, 0.925-0.986), and a specificity
        of 0.863 (95% CI, 0.764-0.961). In the validation set-2, the predictive performance
        of classification was with an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.747-0.845), a sensitivity
        of 0.797 (95% CI, 0.720-0.864), and a specificity of 0.661 (95% CI, 0.606-0.717).
        Our study reveals that gene pair signatures are robust across diverse studies
        and can be utilized as objective biomarkers to distinguish KD from FI, helping
        to develop a fast, simple, and effective molecular approach to improve the
        diagnosis of KD.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/6539398","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,27]],"date-time":"2020-04-27T23:36:21Z","timestamp":1588030581000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Distinguishing

        to its openness and simplicity, Modbus TCP has wide applications to facilitate
        the actual management and control in industrial wireless fields. However,
        its potential security vulnerabilities can also create lots of complicated
        information security challenges, which are increasingly threatening the availability
        of industrial real-time traffic delivery. Although anomaly detection has been
        recognized as a workable security measure to identify attacks, the critical
        step to successfully extract data characteristics is an extremely difficult
        task. In this paper, we focus on the continuous control mode in industrial
        processes and propose a control tracing feature algorithm to extract the function-driven
        tracing characteristics from Modbus TCP data traffic. Furthermore, this algorithm
        can flexibly integrate the time factor with critical functional operations
        and adequately describe the dynamic control change of technological processes.
        To closely cooperate with this algorithm, one optimized SVM (support vector
        machine) classifier is introduced as the practicable decision engine. By designing
        one applicable attack mode, we develop an in-depth and meticulous analysis
        on the decision accuracy, and all experimental results clearly explain that
        the extracted features can strongly reflect the changing pattern of continuous
        functional operations, and the proposed algorithm can effectively cooperate
        with the optimized SVM classifier to distinguish abnormal Modbus TCP data
        traffic.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6839179","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,26]],"date-time":"2021-12-26T19:50:12Z","timestamp":1640548212000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Extracting

        is well known that coalmine gas concentration forecasting is very significant
        to ensure the safety of mining. Owing to the high-frequency, nonstationary
        fluctuations and chaotic properties of the gas concentration time series,
        a gas concentration forecasting model utilizing the original raw data often
        leads to an inability to provide satisfying forecast results. A hybrid forecasting
        model that integrates wavelet transform and extreme learning machine (ELM)
        termed as WELM (wavelet based ELM) for coalmine gas concentration is proposed.
        Firstly, the proposed model employs Mallat algorithm to decompose and reconstruct
        the gas concentration time series to isolate the low-frequency and high-frequency
        information. Then, ELM model is built for the prediction of each component.
        At last, these predicted values are superimposed to obtain the predicted values
        of the original sequence. This method makes an effective separation of the
        feature information of gas concentration time series and takes full advantage
        of multi-ELM prediction models with different parameters to achieve divide
        and rule. Comparative studies with existing prediction models indicate that
        the proposed model is very promising and can be implemented in one-step or
        multistep ahead prediction.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/858260","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,7,23]],"date-time":"2014-07-23T18:26:57Z","timestamp":1406140017000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Short-Term

        is mainly used to determine the distinguishable samples and subsample; the
        second layer is a nonlinear discriminant model, which is used to determine
        the subsample type. Numerical experiments on real data sets show that this

        broadcast is an effective data dissemination technique to enhance the system
        ability to handle dynamic client access patterns. With the development of
        real-time wireless applications, it is practical for clients to request multiple
        related data items with time constraint in one request. For real-time data
        broadcast, items are only useful if they can be received by clients before
        expiration; otherwise, the related requests become invalid. Hence, minimizing
        the number of requests that miss their deadlines becomes an important task
        in on-demand broadcast, especially for multi-item scenario, where more requests
        are inclined to miss their deadlines due to the heavier workload and greater
        complexity, compared with single-item scenario. In this paper, we propose
        a network coding-based scheduling algorithm for real-time multi-item data
        dissemination. The proposed algorithm exploits the coding opportunities between
        cached and requested data items and integrates network coding with data scheduling
        to minimize the deadline miss ratio. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
        that the proposed algorithm achieves the lowest deadline miss ratio under
        various circumstances. In addition, the high efficiency of the proposed algorithm
        in utilizing the transmission bandwidth is proved for that fewer instances
        of ineffective service are provided for satisfying clients\u2019 requests

Expression of nine candidate genes [<jats:italic>Actn2<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Actn3<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Casq1<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Drd2<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Lepr<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Mc4r<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Mstn<\/jats:italic>,<jats:italic>Papss2<\/jats:italic>,

        transcript levels in the soleus were higher in the low-active mice. However,
        when these genes were evaluated in na\u00efve animals, differential expression
        was not observed, demonstrating a training effect. Among na\u00efve mice,
        no genes in either tissue exhibited differential expression between strains.
        Considering that no obvious SNP mechanisms were determined or differential
        expression was observed, our results indicate that genomic structural variation
        or gene expression data alone is not adequate to establish any of these genes\u2019

        study focuses on the problem that the multiobjective optimization decision-making
        process of the design scheme under the cloud service model fails to fully
        consider the needs of users\u2019 diversity, due to the lack of research on
        quantitative modeling and evaluation methods of designers\u2019 ability. It
        affects the reasonable matching between complex design tasks and design ability
        and hinders the socialized aggregation of design ability. Based on the competency
        model, facing the industrial designers in the cloud manufacturing model, our
        paper constructs the design capability evaluation system from the perspectives
        of Yuan Shengren capability, industry technology competency, design task competency,
        and learning capability competency and discusses the design capability evaluation
        method based on a network analysis method. Through the design capability evaluation
        of the industrial design cloud service platform, feasibility and scientificity
        of the method in this paper are verified. This paper proposes a design scheme
        optimization decision-making method combining quality function configuration
        and rough set theory. Based on the analysis of the cloud service model, this
        method introduces the design decision-making process model of user participation
        and fuzzy evaluation mechanism to carry out cluster analysis and the intelligent
        transformation of user requirements. A design scheme evaluation index system
        oriented to user requirements is established, and the importance of design
        scheme evaluation indexes in the process of networked collaborative design
        is accurately quantified. Following the principle of combining scientificity
        and systematicness, a third-order decision-making model for design scheme
        optimization under the cloud service model is proposed. The model is solved
        by combining the rough set theory and rough approximation ideal solution.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/7610040","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,27]],"date-time":"2022-02-27T22:20:07Z","timestamp":1646000407000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Industrial

        data mining has become an increasing concern in the location-based applications,
        and the trajectory partition is taken as the primary procedure of trajectory
        data mining. The amount of movement trajectories of nodes is typically very
        large, and the trajectory shapes are extremely diverse, which makes the trajectory
        partition a vital issue to the trajectory data mining results. In this work,
        the movement behaviors of nodes are analyzed from the aspects of moving speeds,
        stop points, and moving directions, and then a novel Trajectory Partition
        Method based on combined movement Features (TPMF) is proposed to partition
        the trajectories. In TPMF, we first extract the change points where the movement
        speeds of nodes are varied significantly; then, we extract the stop points
        by detecting the speed variations of nodes; finally, the Douglas-Peucker algorithm
        is applied to partition the subtrajectories according to the extracted feature
        points (change points and stop points). Simulations are carried out on the<jats:italic>
        Geolife<\/jats:italic> trajectory dataset, and the simulation results indicate
        that TPMF can achieve a preferable trade-off between the simplification rate
        and the trajectory partition error, while the running time is shortened as
        well.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/7803293","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,24]],"date-time":"2019-07-24T23:31:09Z","timestamp":1564011069000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["A

        information entropy, and acoustic emission damage as precursor discrimination
        indicators for the occurrence of rock explosion. Study of the impact of the

        when the rock rupture acoustic emission RA value time is the earliest. The
        remaining four precursor discrimination indicators of rock rupture with different

        control of breast cancer is the shared domain and responsibility of surgeons
        and radiation oncologists. Because surgeons are often the first providers
        to discuss locoregional control and recurrence risks with patients and because
        they serve in a key gatekeeping role as referring providers for radiation
        therapy, a sophisticated understanding of the evidence regarding radiotherapy
        in breast cancer management is essential for the practicing surgeon. This
        paper synthesizes the complex and evolving evidence regarding the role of
        radiation therapy after mastectomy. Although substantial evidence indicates
        that radiation therapy can reduce the risk of locoregional failure after mastectomy
        (with a relative reduction of risk of approximately two-thirds), debate persists
        regarding the specific subgroups who have sufficient risks of residual microscopic
        locoregional disease after mastectomy to warrant treatment with radiation.
        This paper reviews the evidence available to guide appropriate referral and
        patient decision making, with special attention to areas of controversy, including
        patients with limited nodal disease, those with large tumors but negative
        nodes, node-negative patients with high risk features, patients who have received
        systemic chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting, and patients who may wish

        COQ2 mutations have been reported in Japanese multiple system atrophy (MSA)

        with dementia, 466 patients with ET, and 1038 healthy controls, were included.
        Genotyping for the COQ2 V393A (T&gt;C) was carried out. Odds ratio (OR) adjusted
        by age and gender, together with 95% confidence interval (CI), was reported
        by means of logistic regression.<jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>. The frequency
        of the polymorphic variant V393A heterozygous (T\/C) was 2.7% in dementia,
        1.1% in ET, and 2.5% in controls (OR = 0.70, 95% confidence interval is 0.29\u20131.72

        laying cables are often used at inlet and outlet regions of a power distribution
        cabinet. In order to improve the heat transfer performance and extend service
        life of a trench laying cable, the heat transfer and cable ampacity of the
        trench laying cable with a ceramic plate were numerically studied in the present
        paper and the results were compared with those of a traditional trench laying
        cable. The variations of conductor loss and eddy current loss of different
        loop cables were discussed in the trench with a ceramic plate, and the effects
        of ceramic plate parameters on heat transfer performance of the trench laying
        cable were optimized using the Taguchi method. It is found that for the trench
        with ceramic plates, although the ceramic plate restrains the natural convection
        in the trench, the total heat transfer for natural convection and thermal
        radiation are enhanced for the cables and the cable ampacity can be improved.
        The difference of electromagnetic loss between the upper- and lower-layer
        cables in the trench with ceramic plate is quite small. When the cable core
        current (I) increases from 700\u2009A to 1100\u2009A, the maximum difference
        of averaged electromagnetic loss between the upper- and lower-layer cables
        is 1.22%. With the Taguchi method, an optimum parameter combination is obtained.
        When the length, thickness, and surface emissivity of the ceramic plate are
        equal to 0.48\u2009m, 0.0734\u2009m, and 0.8, respectively, at I\u2009=\u2009900\u2009A,
        the cable maximum temperature in the trench is the lowest.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1227817","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]],"date-time":"2021-09-09T18:51:48Z","timestamp":1631213508000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Numerical

        the past two decades, a number of studies have failed to provide direct evidence
        of specific microbial chronic infection in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).
        However, a recent report suggests that there is a specific association of<jats:italic>Chlamydia
        pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>in patients with PBC and that<jats:italic>C. pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>or
        similar antigens might play a role in the pathogenesis of disease. To determine
        if<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>infection is associated with PBC, we
        applied a combination of immunological and molecular approaches to investigate
        (a) the serological reactivity against two common<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>human
        pathogens,<jats:italic>C. pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>C. trachomatis<\/jats:italic>,
        by immunoblotting, (b) the presence of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>in
        liver samples of patients with PBC and controls by PCR amplification of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>specific
        16S rRNA and (c) the presence of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>proteins
        in liver samples of patients with PBC and controls by immunohistochemical
        staining. By immunoblotting,<jats:italic>C. trachomatis<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>C.
        pneumoniae<\/jats:italic>specific serological antibodies were found in 52\/57
        (91.2%) AMA positive PBC, 7\/33 (21\/2%) of AMA negative PBC, 1\/25 (4%) PSC,
        0\/15 (0%) Sjorgen''s syndrome and 0\/20 (0%) systemic lupus erythematosus
        patients and 0\/20 (0%) healthy volunteers at 1:200 sera dilution. PBC sera
        reacted to<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>and<jats:italic>E. coli<\/jats:italic>lysates
        in western blots up to a maximum of 10<jats:sup>-4<\/jats:sup>dilution. However,
        PCR amplification of the<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>specific 16S
        rRNA gene was negative in 25\/25 PBC livers but positive in 1\/4 PSC liver,
        3\/6 in other liver disease controls and 1\/4 normal liver samples. While
        two commercially available specific monoclonal antibodies stained positive
        controls (<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>infected HEp-2 cells) they
        failed to detect<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>antigens in PBC livers.
        The detection of<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>specific antibodies but
        not<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>rRNA gene and<jats:italic>Chlamydia<\/jats:italic>antigens

        We describe the clinical manifestations of supra-large range nonperfusion
        area (SLRNPA) in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Methods. This was a retrospective
        case-control study. A total of 260 eyes of 236 patients with DR who underwent
        pars plana vitrectomy in the Department of Ophthalmology of Qingdao Municipal
        Hospital from February 2016 to June 2019 were enrolled. Fundus fluorescein
        angiography was performed after surgery to determine whether SLRNPA or non-SLRNPA
        in DR was present. All demographic and clinical data were carefully collected.
        Results. Forty-one eyes of 22 patients were diagnosed with SLRNPA in DR (15.77%
        of all eyes). Compared to non-SLRNPA, SLRNPA patients were more likely to
        be male and younger with earlier DR onset, a smoking history, other comorbidities,
        and a higher HbA1c level. SLRNPA in DR eyes exhibited more neovascular glaucoma
        (NVG) and diabetic keratopathy (DK) than did other eyes. Such eyes were more
        likely to require anti-VEGF therapy before surgery or a silicone oil or a
        gas tamponade during surgery and to suffer from persistent corneal epithelial
        erosion and NVG recurrence after surgery. Conclusions. SLRNPA in DR is a severe
        status of DR. Treatment for DR patients with SLRNPA is difficult, and the
        prognosis is poor, so clinicians must thus pay more attention to SLRNPA in
        DR.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/8775641","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]],"date-time":"2022-02-04T03:06:07Z","timestamp":1643943967000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Clinical

        use of magnetorheological dampers has rapidly spread to many engineering applications,
        especially those related to transportation and civil engineering. The problem
        arises upon modelling their highly nonlinear behaviour: in spite of the huge
        number of apparently accurate models in the literature, most fail when considering
        the overall magnetomechanical behaviour. In this study, a brief but broad
        review of different magnetorheological damper models has been carried out,
        which includes characterisation, modelling, and comparison. Unlike many other
        studies, the analyses cover the behaviour from preyield to postyield regions
        of the MR fluid. The performance of the different models has been assessed
        by means of numerous experimental tests and by means of simulations in a simple
        and straightforward semiactive control case study. The results obtained prove
        that most models usually fail in predicting accurate low-velocity behaviour
        (before iron chains yield) and, as a result, may lead to bad estimations when
        used in control schemes due to modelling errors and chattering.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2019\/5636053","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]],"date-time":"2019-05-02T23:35:25Z","timestamp":1556840125000},"page":"1-23","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Modelling

        order to explore marine natural resources using remote robotic sensor or to
        enable rapid information exchange between ROV (remotely operated vehicles),
        AUV (autonomous underwater vehicle), divers, and ships, ultrasonic underwater
        communication systems are used. However, if the communication system is applied
        to rich living creature marine environment such as shallow sea, it suffers
        from generated Impulsive Noise so-called Shrimp Noise, which is randomly generated
        in time domain and seriously degrades communication performance in underwater
        acoustic network. With the purpose of supporting high performance underwater
        communication, a robust digital communication method for Impulsive Noise environments
        is necessary. In this paper, we propose OFDM ultrasonic communication system
        with diversity receiver. The main feature of the receiver is a newly proposed
        Frequency Domain Diversity Combined Impulsive Noise Canceller. The OFDM receiver
        utilizes 20\u201328\u2009KHz ultrasonic channel and subcarrier spacing of
        46.875\u2009Hz (MODE3) and 93.750\u2009Hz (MODE2) OFDM modulations. In addition,
        the paper shows Impulsive Noise distribution data measured at a fishing port
        in Okinawa and at a barge in Shizuoka prefectures and then proposed diversity
        OFDM transceivers architecture and experimental results are described. By
        the proposed Impulsive Noise Canceller, frame bit error rate has been decreased

        versatile potentiometer that works with electrode arrays in flow injection
        and\/or monosegmented flow systems is described. The potentiometer is controlled
        by a microcomputer that allows individual, sequential multiplexed or random
        accesses to eight electrodes while employing only one reference electrode.
        The instrument was demonstrated by monitoring an array of seven flow-through
        ion-selective electrodes for Ag<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>and for three electrodes
        for Cl<jats:sup>-<\/jats:sup>, Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>and K<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>.
        The figures of merit of the individual and multiplexed (summed) readings of
        the electrode array were compared. The absolute standard deviation of the
        measurements made by summing the potential of two or more electrodes was maintained
        constant, thus improving the precision of the measurements. This result shows
        that an attempt to combine the signals of the electrodes to produce a more
        intense signal in the Hadamard strategy is feasible and accompanied by a proportional
        improvement in the precision of individual measurements. The preliminary tests
        suggest that the system can allow for 270 determinations per hour, with a

        intelligent information system constructed by the sensor web can monitor all
        kinds of sudden abnormal events, improve the ability of event discovery and
        rapid disposal, and promote the development of smart city and the construction
        of the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we consider the problem of
        complex integration and poor expansibility in the large-scale full-network
        operation and maintenance system construction and propose an active and passive
        event service (APES) method based on the sensor web. In the APES, a system
        framework with the perception layer, data service layer, event service layer,
        and user layer is firstly defined and constructed. Secondly, a middleware
        with the ability to active and passive event service (APES) is designed and
        implemented based on the system framework. Finally, taking abnormal weather
        and fire warning as examples, the performance of the proposed event service
        middleware is tested, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed
        APES model in this paper has the advantages of high precision, stable operation,
        and strong practicability and solves \u201cInformation Island\u201d and low
        reusability in the whole network operation and maintenance system. This is
        an attempt at the structural design of a similar intelligent information system.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/2578744","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]],"date-time":"2022-02-01T00:50:09Z","timestamp":1643676609000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["A

        with the common marine renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and wave
        energy, etc., the hydraulic pressure stored in the deep seawater can output
        stable and successive energy flow. Thus, it can be directly coupled with the
        reverse osmosis (RO) process to supply drinkable mineral water for crews of
        Deep Sea Space Station (DSSS). We proposed a novel submarine RO desalination
        system driven by the hydraulic pressure of deep seawater (SHP-RO), composed
        of a desalination branch to generate fresh water and a back pressure branch
        to ensure the depth independence of the desalination. The influences of the
        deep sea environment on the RO were analyzed, based on which the pretreatment
        of the seawater and the preparation of the drinkable mineral water were studied.
        The turbine-based energy recovery scheme was investigated in virtue of the
        CFD simulation on the flow behavior in the different turbine series. It was
        predicted that, when the DSSS was located at the depth of 1100\u2009m and
        the operating pressure of the RO process was 6.0\u2009MPa, for a drinkable
        water production rate of 240\u2009m3\/d, the recovered hydraulic pressure
        energy can achieve 39.22\u2009kW\u00b7h, which was enough for driving electricity

        Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the leading liver cancer with special immune
        microenvironment, which played vital roles in tumor relapse and poor drug
        responses. In this study, we aimed to explore the prognostic immune signatures
        in HCC and tried to construct an immune-risk model for patient evaluation.
        Methods. RNA sequencing profiles of HCC patients were collected from the cancer
        genome Atlas (TCGA), international cancer genome consortium (ICGC), and gene
        expression omnibus (GEO) databases (GSE14520). Differentially expressed immune
        genes, derived from ImmPort database and MSigDB signaling pathway lists, between
        tumor and normal tissues were analyzed with Limma package in R environment.
        Univariate Cox regression was performed to find survival-related immune genes
        in TCGA dataset, and in further random forest algorithm analysis, significantly
        changed immune genes were used to generate a multivariate Cox model to calculate
        the corresponding immune-risk score. The model was examined in the other two
        datasets with recipient operation curve (ROC) and survival analysis. Risk
        effects of immune-risk score and clinical characteristics of patients were
        individually evaluated, and significant factors were then used to generate
        a nomogram. Results. There were 52 downregulated and 259 upregulated immune
        genes between tumor and relatively normal tissues, and the final immune-risk
        model (based on SPP1, BRD8, NDRG1, KITLG, HSPA4, TRAF3, ITGAV and MAP4K2)
        can better differentiate patients into high and low immune-risk subpopulations,
        in which high score patients showed worse outcomes after resection (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math
        xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\" id=\"M1\">\n                        <mi>p<\/mi>\n                        <mo>&lt;<\/mo>\n                        <mn>0.05<\/mn>\n                     <\/math>\n                  <\/jats:inline-formula>).
        The differentially enriched pathways between the two groups were mainly about
        cell proliferation and cytokine production, and calculated immune-risk score
        was also highly correlated with immune infiltration levels. The nomogram,
        constructed with immune-risk score and tumor stages, showed high accuracy
        and clinical benefits in prediction of 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival,
        which is useful in clinical practice. Conclusion. The immune-risk model, based
        on expression of SPP1, BRD8, NDRG1, KITLG, HSPA4, TRAF3, ITGAV, and MAP4K2,
        can better differentiate patients into high and low immune-risk groups. Combined
        nomogram, using immune-risk score and tumor stages, could make accurate prediction
        of 1-, 3- and 5-year survival in HCC patients.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6676537","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,18]],"date-time":"2021-03-18T19:35:06Z","timestamp":1616096106000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Machine

        merchants enter hybrid e-commerce platforms (such as JD.com and Amazon), they
        will face issues such as which sales methods to choose and whether to use
        platform logistics under different power structures. Different sales methods
        and logistics service strategies have resulted in three operating modes: (a)
        resale mode, marked as A, (b) agency\u2009+\u2009no-platform logistics, marked
        as B, and (c) agency\u2009+\u2009platform logistics, marked as C. This paper
        constructs an analysis framework composed of an e-commerce platform and a
        merchant to explore the optimal operating mode. The game models of the three
        modes are first constructed, and then, the equilibrium results are compared
        and analysed. Based on the results of comparative analysis and considering
        the dynamic game between the e-commerce platform and the merchant regarding
        sales methods and logistics service strategies, the optimal operating mode
        is determined. The results show that when the platform has absolute power,
        mode C is optimal for it. When the logistics service sensitivity coefficient
        and market size are both large, the best for the merchant with absolute power
        is mode B. In addition, if neither of them has absolute power, only when the
        merchant first decides the logistics service strategy, then the platform decides
        the sales method; the best for both parties is mode B; otherwise, the best
        is mode A. This research has generated new insights and has practical management
        significance, which can provide guidance for merchant and platform decision-making.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/7653068","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]],"date-time":"2021-12-15T02:05:08Z","timestamp":1639533908000},"page":"1-14","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Considering

        The local memory has to be used by applications that access data randomly.
        A typical case belonging to this category is image registration. On the other
        hand, an application such as edge detection can directly read data through
        the interconnect in a sequential fashion. Two different algorithms of image
        registration, the exhaustive search algorithm and the Discrete Wavelet Transform
        (DWT)-based search algorithm, are implemented on hardware, i.e., Xilinx Vertex-IIPro

        air traffic flow management (ATFM) is an effective way to alleviate demand-capacity
        imbalances globally and thereafter reduce airspace congestion and flight delays.
        The conventional ATFM models assume the capacities of airports or airspace
        sectors are all predetermined. However, the capacity uncertainties due to
        the dynamics of convective weather may make the deterministic ATFM measures
        impractical. This paper investigates the stochastic air traffic network flow
        optimization (SATNFO) problem, which is formulated as a weighted biobjective
        0-1 integer programming model. In order to evaluate the effect of capacity
        uncertainties on ATFM, the operational risk is modeled via probabilistic risk
        assessment and introduced as an extra objective in SATNFO problem. Computation
        experiments using real-world air traffic network data associated with simulated
        weather data show that presented model has far less constraints compared to
        stochastic model with nonanticipative constraints, which means our proposed
        model reduces the computation complexity.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2015\/742541","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2015,6,10]],"date-time":"2015-06-10T20:22:22Z","timestamp":1433967742000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["A

        people activity recognition has become a vital necessity in many countries,
        because most of the elderly people live alone and are vulnerable. Thus, more
        research to advance in the monitoring systems used to recognize the activities
        of elderly people is required. Many researchers have proposed different monitoring
        systems for activity recognition using wired and wireless wearable sensing
        devices. However, the activity classification accuracy achieved so far should
        be improved to meet the challenges of more precise activity monitoring. Our
        study proposes a smart Human Activity Recognition system architecture utilizing
        an open source dataset generated by wireless, batteryless sensors used by
        14 healthy aged persons and unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms.
        In this paper, we also propose using a smart grid for checking regularly the
        wearable sensing device operational status to address the well-known reliability
        challenges of these devices, such as wireless charging and data trustworthiness.
        As the data from the sensing device is very noisy, we employ the K-means++
        clustering to identify outliers and use advanced ensemble classification techniques,
        such as the stacking classifier for which a meta model built using the random
        forest algorithm gave better results than all other base models considered.
        We also employ a bagging classifier, which is an ensemble meta-estimator fitting
        the prediction outputs of the base classifiers and aggregating them to produce
        the ensemble output. The best classification accuracy of 99.81 was achieved
        by the stacking classifier in training and 99.78% in testing, respectively.
        Comparisons for finding the best model were conducted using the recall, F1
        score, and precision values.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/9540033","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,23]],"date-time":"2022-03-23T01:20:06Z","timestamp":1647998406000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Elderly

        paper focused on choosing the best design of subsurface land drainage systems
        in semiarid areas. The study presented three different soil layers with different
        hydraulic conductivity and permeability, all layers are below the drain level,
        and the permeability is increasing with depth. A mathematical model was formulated
        for the horizontal and vertical drainage optimal design. The result was a
        nonlinear optimization problem with nonlinear constraints, which required
        numerical methods for its solution. The purpose of the mathematical model
        is to find the best values of pipes and tubewells spacing, groundwater table
        drawdown, and pumps operating hours which leads to a minimum total cost of
        the subsurface drainage design. A computer code was developed in MATLAB environment
        and applied to the case study. Results show that the vertical drainage was
        economically better for the case study drainage network design. And the main
        factor affecting the mathematical model for both pipe and well drainage was
        the distance between pipes and tubewells. In addition, considering the lifespan
        of vertical drainage project, the optimal design involves the minimum possible
        duration of pumping stations. It is hoped that the proposed optimal mathematical
        model will present a design methodology by which the costs of all alternative
        designs can be compared so that the least-cost design is selected.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8827300","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,16]],"date-time":"2021-06-16T19:05:08Z","timestamp":1623870308000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The

        a real world application, we seldom get all images at one time. Considering
        this case, if a company hired an employee, all his images information needs
        to be recorded into the system; if we rerun the face recognition algorithm,
        it will be time consuming. To address this problem, In this paper, firstly,
        we proposed a novel subspace incremental method called incremental graph regularized
        nonnegative matrix factorization (IGNMF) algorithm which imposes manifold
        into incremental nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm (INMF); thus,
        our new algorithm is able to preserve the geometric structure in the data
        under incremental study framework; secondly, considering we always get many
        face images belonging to one person or many different people as a batch, we
        improved our IGNMF algorithms to Batch-IGNMF algorithms (B-IGNMF), which implements
        incremental study in batches. Experiments show that (1) the recognition rate
        of our IGNMF and B-IGNMF algorithms is close to GNMF algorithm while it runs
        faster than GNMF. (2) The running times of our IGNMF and B-IGNMF algorithms
        are close to INMF while the recognition rate outperforms INMF. (3) Comparing
        with other popular NMF-based face recognition incremental algorithms, our
        IGNMF and B-IGNMF also outperform then both the recognition rate and the running
        time.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/928051","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,19]],"date-time":"2014-05-19T17:27:48Z","timestamp":1400520468000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":9,"title":["Incremental

        and Aim. With regard to patients with intermediate-stage, irresectable hepatocellular
        carcinoma (HCC), transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the mainstay
        of treatment. There is an urgent clinical requirement to identify reliable
        biomarkers to predict the response of HCC patients to TACE treatment. We aimed
        to identify a gene signature for predicting TACE response in HCC patients
        based on bioinformatics analysis. Methods. We downloaded the gene expression
        profile GSE104580 based on 147 tumor samples from 81 responders to TACE and
        66 nonresponders from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, we
        randomly divided the 147 tumor samples into a training set (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        and a validation set (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        and screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the training set. Gene
        Ontology (GO) term and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
        enrichment analyses were performed to annotate functions of the DEGs. The
        DEGs were mapped into the STRING website for constructing protein-protein
        interaction (PPI). The predictive value of the candidate genes by receiver-operating
        characteristic (ROC) curves was further verified in the validation set. Results.
        We totally found 158 DEGs (92 upregulated genes and 66 downregulated genes)
        in the training set. The GO enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were significantly
        enriched in metabolic and catabolic processes, such as drug metabolic process,
        fatty acid metabolic process, and small molecule catabolic process. The KEGG
        pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly concentrated in drug metabolism-cytochrome
        P450, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, and chemical carcinogenesis.
        We identified 6 candidate genes (CXCL8, AFP, CYP1A1, MMP9, CYP3A4, and SERPINC1)
        based on the PPI network of the DEGs, which had high predictive value in HCC
        response to TACE with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.875 and 0.897
        for the training set and validation set, respectively. Conclusion. We identified
        a six-gene signature which might be biomarkers for predicting HCC response
        to TACE by a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. However, the actual functions
        of these genes required verification.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3249816","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T22:50:08Z","timestamp":1626475808000},"page":"1-10","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Identifying

        permutation flow shop scheduling problem (PFSSP) is part of production scheduling,
        which belongs to the hardest combinatorial optimization problem. In this paper,
        a multipopulation particle swarm optimization (PSO) based memetic algorithm
        (MPSOMA) is proposed in this paper. In the proposed algorithm, the whole particle
        swarm population is divided into three subpopulations in which each particle
        evolves itself by the standard PSO and then updates each subpopulation by
        using different local search schemes such as variable neighborhood search
        (VNS) and individual improvement scheme (IIS). Then, the best particle of
        each subpopulation is selected to construct a probabilistic model by using
        estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and three particles are sampled
        from the probabilistic model to update the worst individual in each subpopulation.
        The best particle in the entire particle swarm is used to update the global
        optimal solution. The proposed MPSOMA is compared with two recently proposed
        algorithms, namely, PSO based memetic algorithm (PSOMA) and hybrid particle
        swarm optimization with estimation of distribution algorithm (PSOEDA), on
        29 well-known PFFSPs taken from OR-library, and the experimental results show

        the overhauling of the internal combustion engine, a lot of tools are used
        and among them is the poppet valve spring compressor. In Ghana, auto mechanics
        at the \u201cway-side\u201d garages make use of improvised tools, such as
        pipes, pliers, and push rods, for compressing valve springs. However, there
        are some challenges associated with the usage of these tools which include
        misplacement of cotters, injuries, and sometimes valve bends. In this work,
        a review of some of the existing designs of the improvised tools was considered.
        Also, a survey was conducted to seek the opinion of users (auto technicians
        and\/or mechanics) of the tools. A design was made for spring compression
        by incorporating a magnet with a pull force of 679.78\u2009N to take care
        of the removal of cotters during valve assembly dismantling. In this research,
        an efficient and user-friendly poppet valve spring compression tool with a
        total mass of 0.88\u2009kg was designed. Finite element analysis (FEA) was
        performed on the upper and lower parts of the tool to examine its response
        due to the loads that act on it during operation. It was discovered from the
        analysis that the upper frame of the valve spring compressor experienced the
        highest von Mises stress of 59.77\u2009MPa at the neck region, whilst the
        corresponding fatigue analysis showed a maximum fatigue life of 8.355\u2009\u00d7\u200910<jats:sup>9<\/jats:sup>

        In the resultant complex heterostructures, Ag nanocrystals were mainly deposited
        on the surface of Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O, while Ag-Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O
        composites were anchored onto GO sheets. The resultant Ag-Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O\/GO
        nanocomposites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity with 90% of methyl
        orange (MO) dye degradation efficiency after 60\u2009min of visible-light
        irradiation, which was much higher than that of either Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O
        or Ag-Cu<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O. This study opens a new avenue to fabricate
        visible-light-responsive photocatalyst with high performance for environmental

        antigen-specific T cell function is limited by immune tolerance in the tumor
        microenvironment. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells upregulate PD-L1
        expression to promote T cell exhaustion by PD-1\/PD-L1 interactions and undergo
        mutations to avoid being targeted by tumor antigen-specific T cells. Thus,
        tumor cells escape the immune surveillance by causing immune tolerance. We
        reason that a chimeric molecule made of a PD-L1-specific antibody linked to
        a cleavable antigenic peptide can target the antigenic peptide to the tumor
        microenvironment, resulting in the blockade of the PD-1\/PD-L1 pathway and
        killing tumor cells through the coating of antigenic peptide. Here, we have
        generated a therapeutic chimeric protein containing the PD-L1 single-chain
        variable fragment (scFv) linked to a cleavable model cytotoxic T lymphocyte
        (CTL) epitope: E7 CTL peptide. Our study demonstrated that our chimeric protein
        (named PDL1-scFv-Fc-RE7) can target PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and enable
        E7 presentation by releasing cleavable E7 CTL peptide to coat tumor cells,
        resulting in tumor clearance by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. The presentation
        of the E7 peptide by cancer cells can then render tumor cells susceptible
        to the killing of preexisting E7-specific CD8+ T cells and contribute to tumor
        clearance. Our finding suggests a synergistic approach to not only enhance
        antigen-specific tumor clearance but also bypass immune tolerance.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/9054569","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,4]],"date-time":"2022-01-04T23:50:18Z","timestamp":1641340218000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Control

        were started every five years in the period of 1960\u20132005, with the initial
        conditions taken from the assimilation runs. The decadal prediction experiment
        by FGOALS-s2 shows significant high predictive skills in the Indian Ocean,
        tropical western Pacific, and Atlantic, similar to the results of the CMIP5
        multimodel ensemble. The predictive skills in the Indian Ocean and tropical
        western Pacific are primarily attributed to the model response to the external
        radiative forcing associated with the change of atmospheric compositions.
        In contrast, the high skills in the Atlantic are attributed, at least partly,
        to the improvements in the prediction of the Atlantic multidecadal variability

        is quite clear that the ability to perceive taste sensations significantly
        affects food choice, which consequently affects health status in the long
        term. Gustatory dysfunction is a neglected symptom among the depressed patients
        and those under antidepressants therapy, although these patients are suspectable
        to oral problems, due to general self-negligence related to mental disease,
        fear of dental treatment, and side effects of varied medications utilized
        in psychiatry. This study is aimed at assessing gustatory thresholds (detection
        and recognition thresholds) among a sample of 30 depressed Egyptian adults
        under antidepressants therapy for at least 3 months or psychotherapy with
        age ranging from 20 to 50 years old, seeking the Psychiatric Clinic at the
        Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. These patients were distributed
        into three equal groups (tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), selective serotonin
        reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and psychotherapy) and were assessed for gustatory
        detection and recognition thresholds using the filter paper disc method through
        a scoring system. The participants were also divided into normal taste group
        in which both the detection and recognition scores were 1, while the scores
        from 2 till 5 were considered as hypogeusia group and the score of 6 was considered
        as dysgeusia group. The TCA group was statistically significant from the other
        2 groups in sweet detection thresholds (<jats:inline-formula>\n                     <math

        where it was more common among TCA (70%) than both SSRIs and the psychotherapy
        group (20%). Gustatory dysfunction was found to be mostly associated with
        TCA followed by SSRIs particularly for sweet taste thresholds. More attention
        has to be given to taste changes among these patients as oral health affects
        general health by causing considerable pain and by changing what people eat,
        their speech, and their quality of life and wellbeing. Proper awareness and
        evaluation of this problem will improve the quality of life for the depressed
        patients and avoid unnecessary treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov

        fusion energy gains close to 100 when irradiated with an appropriate heavy
        ion beam. To reach such performances, we found that a high-Z radiation shield
        was necessary to screen the DT fuel from the radiation coming from the surrounding
        hot material. As opacity of high-Z materials is only weakly density dependent,
        we considered targets with lead shields both at solid density and with a density
        equivalent to that of the contiguous external material. The behaviour of both
        kinds of targets has been studied by introducing a small spatial nonuniformity
        on the external surface of the lead shield. Targets with low-density shields
        have been tested with a beam intensity perturbation, too. Because density
        gradients are very sharp and ablation is practically absent, we have found
        these implosions to be Rayleigh-Taylor unstable. The evolution has been followed
        in the nonlinear regime because the full hydrodynamical-radiative model with
        a nonlinear heavy ion energy deposition and mesh correction was used.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0263034600006698","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2009,3,9]],"date-time":"2009-03-09T16:26:04Z","timestamp":1236615964000},"page":"447-459","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Rayleigh-Taylor

        nanotubes (CNTs) have been widely utilized as a novel drug carrier with promising
        future applications in biomedical therapies due to their distinct characteristics.
        In the present work, carboxylic acid-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes
        (f-SWCNTs) were used as the starting material to react with anticancer drug,
        BA to produce f-SWCNTs-BA conjugate via<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"

        capacity, physicochemical properties, surface morphology, drug releasing characteristics,
        and cytotoxicity evaluation. The results indicated that the drug loading capacity
        was determined to be around 20\u2009wt% and this value has been verified by
        thermogravimetric analysis. The binding of BA onto the surface of f-SWCNTs
        was confirmed by FTIR and Raman spectroscopies. Powder XRD analysis showed
        that the structure of the conjugate was unaffected by the loading of BA. The
        developed conjugate was found to release the drug in a controlled manner with
        a prolonged release property. According to the preliminary<jats:italic>in
        vitro<\/jats:italic>cytotoxicity studies, the conjugate was not toxic in a
        standard fibroblast cell line, and anticancer activity was significantly higher
        in A549 than HepG2 cell line. This study suggests that f-SWCNTs could be developed
        as an efficient drug carrier to conjugate drugs for pharmaceutical applications

        10 (<jats:italic>CAPN10<\/jats:italic>) variants have been associated with
        the genetic susceptibility to type 2 diabetes (T2D). In the present case-control
        study, we analysed the distribution of SNP-19 insertion\/deletion (I\/D) polymorphism
        in a total of 607 samples (103 T2D cases and 102 healthy controls) from Brahmin;
        (100 T2D cases and 100 healthy controls) from Bania and (100 T2D cases and
        102 healthy controls) from Jat Sikh ethnic groups of the North-West Indian
        population. Increased frequency of I allele and II genotype was found in T2D
        in Brahmin ethnic group [<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7003,
        OR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00b783 (1\u00b743\u20135\u00b761 at 95% CI)]. Significant
        correlation between II genotype and body mass index (BMI) was also observed
        [<jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic>\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7003, OR\u00a0=\u00a03\u00b731
        (1\u00b752\u20137\u00b720 at 95% CI)]. No association for the genotypes and
        alleles was seen in Banias and Jat Sikhs. Our data suggests that SNP-19 I\/D
        variation in the <jats:italic>CAPN10<\/jats:italic> gene is modulated by ethnicity
        and influences the susceptibility to T2D in the North-West Indian population.
        We also performed a meta-analysis of relevant studies to assess the validity
        of this association. Data from 13 case-control studies with 15\u00a0760 samples
        comprising of 8395 T2D cases and 7365 controls were finally analysed. Significant
        heterogeneity between individual studies was evident in dominant and codominant
        models. The results of present meta-analysis indicate an association of T2D
        with carriers of DD genotype of <jats:italic>CAPN10<\/jats:italic> I\/D polymorphism.
        However, further analyses on a larger sample size are required to establish
        a conclusive association in meta-analysis.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/s0016672313000207","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,15]],"date-time":"2014-01-15T13:45:01Z","timestamp":1389793501000},"page":"146-155","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Ethnic

        simple high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the simultaneous
        separation of the highly polar and weakly polar components of traditional
        Chinese medicines was developed via a strategic combination of isocratic and
        gradient elution methods. Liu-Shen-Wan and Liu-Wei-Di-Huang-Wan were used
        as representative examples of traditional Chinese medicines. This is the first
        time that 6 components of varying degrees of polarity in Liu-Shen-Wan had
        been successfully resolved in a single chromatographic run using an ultraviolet-visible
        detector with a fixed wavelength of 296\u2009nm. In contrast to conventional
        gradient separation methods, this novel method offered a viable route for
        separation of the highly and weakly polar fractions simultaneously, thus greatly
        reducing the time and cost of analysis. This method therefore provides a more
        efficient way to determine the polar components present in traditional Chinese
        medicines. It would find potential application in drug screening, drug authentication,
        and product quality control.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2018\/7569283","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,3,19]],"date-time":"2018-03-19T19:33:00Z","timestamp":1521487980000},"page":"1-6","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Strategic

        Data supporting hypofractionated preoperative radiation therapy (RT) for patients
        with extremity and trunk soft tissue sarcoma (STS) are currently limited to
        phase II single-institution studies. We sought to understand the type and
        thresholds of clinical evidence required for experts to adopt hypofractionated
        RT as a standard-of-care option for patients with STS. Methods. An electronic
        survey was distributed to multidisciplinary sarcoma experts. The survey queried
        whether data from a theoretical, multi-institutional, phase II study of 5-fraction
        preoperative RT could change practice. Using endpoints from RTOG 0630 as a
        reference, the survey also queried thresholds for acceptable local control,
        wound complication, and late toxicity for the study protocol to be accepted
        as a standard-of-care option. Responses were logged from 8\/27\/2020 to 9\/8\/2020
        and summarized graphically. Results. The survey response rate was 55.3% (47\/85).
        Local control is the most important clinical outcome for sarcoma specialists
        when evaluating whether an RT regimen should be considered standard of care.
        17% (8\/47) of providers require randomized phase III evidence to consider
        hypofractionated preoperative RT as a standard-of-care option, whereas 10.6%
        (5\/47) of providers already view this as a standard-of-care option. Of providers
        willing to change practice based on phase II data, most (78%, 29\/37) would
        accept local control rates equivalent to or less than those in RTOG 0630,
        as long as the rate was higher than 85%. However, 51.3% (19\/37) would require
        wound complication rates superior to those reported in RTOG 0630, and 46%
        (17\/37) of respondents would accept late toxicity rates inferior to RTOG
        0630. Conclusion. Consensus building is needed among clinicians regarding
        the type and threshold of evidence needed to evaluate hypofractionated RT
        as a standard-of-care option. A collaborative consortium-based approach may
        be the most pragmatic means for developing consensus protocols and pooling
        data to gradually introduce hypofractionated preoperative RT into routine
        practice.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/3735874","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,27]],"date-time":"2021-10-27T00:20:07Z","timestamp":1635294007000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Evaluating

        long-range NoC link enables efficient implementation of network-on-chip topologies
        which inherently require high-performance long-distance point-to-point communication
        such as torus and fat-tree structures. In addition, the performance of other
        topologies, such as mesh, can be improved by using high-performance link between
        few selected remote nodes. We presented novel implementation of high-performance
        long-range NoC link based on multilevel current-mode signaling and delay-insensitive
        two-phase 1-of-4 encoding. Current-mode signaling reduces the communication
        latency of long wires significantly compared to voltage-mode signaling, making
        it possible to achieve high throughput without pipelining and\/or using repeaters.
        The performance of the proposed multilevel current-mode interconnect is analyzed
        and compared with two reference voltage mode interconnects. These two reference
        interconnects are designed using two-phase 1-of-4 encoded voltage-mode signaling,
        one with pipeline stages and the other using optimal repeater insertion. The
        proposed multilevel current-mode interconnect achieves higher throughput and
        lower latency than the two reference interconnects. Its throughput at 8 mm
        wire length is 1.222 GWord\/s which is 1.58 and 1.89 times higher than the
        pipelined and optimal repeater insertion interconnects, respectively. Furthermore,
        its power consumption is less than the optimal repeater insertion voltage-mode
        interconnect, at 10 mm wire length its power consumption is 0.75 mW while
        the reference repeater insertion interconnect is 1.066 mW. The effect of crosstalk
        is analyzed using four-bit parallel data transfer with the best-case and worst-case
        switching patterns and a transmission line model which has both capacitive
        coupling and inductive coupling.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2007\/46514","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2007,5,10]],"date-time":"2007-05-10T08:22:07Z","timestamp":1178785327000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":15,"title":["High-Performance

        springs of the volcanic zones are characterized for having high sulfur content
        in the form of sulphate and other ions resulting from chemical reactions.
        Sources with these types of elements are of great interest for the tourism
        and geothermal industry because of their highlighted properties which include
        therapeutic treatments, relaxation baths, agricultural applications, and preservation
        of flora and fauna among others. For these reasons, research oriented to carry
        out the characterization of these factors is of great importance to determine
        the availability of places with such characteristics. This work shows the
        characterization of 17 hot spring sources located in the Coconuco and San
        Juan sectors (Cauca, Colombia, South America). Water samples were taken in
        May 2017, and laboratory analyses were carried out by the Water Laboratory
        at Universidad Nacional de Colombia-Manizales, based on the Standard Methods
        (APHA-AWWA-WEF). Rock samples were taken in November 2017, and laboratory
        analyses were carried out by the GMAS<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> Laboratory (Bogot\u00e1,
        Colombia). The Piper, Stiff, and ternary (Giggenbach) diagrams were used for
        the classification of major ions. Mineralogy composition was determined through
        XRD and XRF. Results indicate that most sources are of the sulphated type
        according to the anions and of the calcium type according to the cations.
        In concordance with Giggenbach diagrams, most of the sources are immature
        waters and, despite their interaction with rocks, they have not achieved the
        equilibrium. Likewise, these sources are of heated vapor type and, considering
        that they consist of sulphated acid sources, it is not possible to evaluate
        the reservoir temperatures from Na\/K cations. The low Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>\/Mg<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>
        ratio in the sources indicates the lack of direct migration of fluids and
        the high content of Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup> and Mg<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>
        regarding Na<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup> and K<jats:sup>+<\/jats:sup>, which suggests
        that fluids possibly are mixed with cold waters rich in Ca<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>
        and Mg<jats:sup>2+<\/jats:sup>. From the mineralogic characterization, it
        was observed that volcanic rocks are composed of cristobalite and albite with
        TiO<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>, Fe<jats:sub>2<\/jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3<\/jats:sub>,

        Phakic Intraocular Lens (P-IOL) implantation is a safe, easy, predictable
        intervention designed to manage moderate to high refractive errors. Complications
        are relatively uncommon and include mainly cataract and intraocular pressure
        spikes. Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS) is a rather unusual sterile
        anterior segment inflammation after uneventful intraocular surgery, extremely
        rarely reported after P-IOL implantation. Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome (UZS) is
        also very rarely described after P-IOL. To date, to the best of the authors\u2019
        knowledge, no article has ever described the simultaneous occurrence of TASS
        and UZS in a patient after P-IOL implantation. Objective. In this article,
        the authors present the case of a female patient with moderate myopic astigmatism,
        who underwent sequential P-IOL implantation at two different facilities. The
        postoperative course of the first eye was uneventful, but she developed complications
        associated to the intervention in the second eye. Materials. The article describes
        the case of a young patient who underwent a sequential Phakic Intraocular
        Lens (P-IOL) implantation at two different institutions. The postoperative
        course of the first eye (left eye) was uneventful; however, the second eye
        (right eye) initially developed Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS). Although
        timely and correct management was instituted, upon resolution of TASS, the
        patient developed Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome, anterior subcapsular cataract,
        and significant endothelial damage in the same eye. Results. The patient was
        followed closely and managed accordingly; corneal edema and anterior segment
        inflammation of the right eye eventually resolved. Nevertheless, an anterior
        subcapsular cataract and a fixed dilated pupil remained; with normal intraocular
        pressure (IOP). Specular microscopy confirmed an endothelial cell loss in
        the TASS eye (right eye). Pupil size showed no reaction to repeated doses

        which resulted in a 20\/50 vision. Conclusions. TASS and UZS are both extremely
        rare complications after uneventful P-IOL implantation, with only a handful
        of cases having been reported of each of them. To date, this is the very first
        case where UZS ensued after and potentially as a consequence of TASS in a
        patient who had undergone P-IOL implantation. Although a direct causative
        element could not be pinpointed, the fact that the complication ensued after
        being operated in one surgical institution and not the other, could suggest
        some role of different sterilization and handling procedures, but no direct
        conclusion can be made on this case.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/1216578","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,4]],"date-time":"2020-11-04T19:35:11Z","timestamp":1604518511000},"page":"1-7","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Unilateral

        To evaluate the vascular response after directional coronary atherectomy (DCA)
        for left main (LM) bifurcation lesion. Methods. This study was a retrospective,
        single-center study enrolling 31 patients who underwent stentless therapy
        using DCA followed by drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty for LM bifurcation
        lesion. We compared intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) findings before and after
        DCA. Results. After DCA, the lumen and vessel areas significantly increased,
        whereas the plaque area (PA) and %PA were significantly reduced. When the
        lesions were divided into small vessel and large vessel groups using the median
        value of the vessel area, the maximum balloon pressure of the DCA catheter
        was greater in the large vessel group. Changes in the lumen and vessel areas
        were also significantly greater in the large vessel group. On the other hand,
        the changes in PA and %PA were similar between groups. Conclusions. The main
        vascular responses associated with lumen enlargement after DCA were plaque
        reduction and vessel expansion. Contribution of vessel expansion to lumen
        enlargement was larger than the effect of plaque reduction in large vessel
        lesions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/5541843","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,14]],"date-time":"2021-12-14T22:05:08Z","timestamp":1639519508000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Vascular

        analysis is applied to quantitatively analyze the impact of different ambient

        machine translation is a natural language processing research direction that
        has important scientific research value and practical value in the current
        artificial intelligence boom. The variability of language, the limited ability
        to express semantic information, and the lack of parallel corpus resources
        all limit the usefulness and popularity of English machine translation in
        practical applications. The self-attention mechanism has received a lot of
        attention in English machine translation tasks because of its highly parallelizable
        computing ability, which reduces the model\u2019s training time and allows
        it to capture the semantic relevance of all words in the context. The efficiency
        of the self-attention mechanism, however, differs from that of recurrent neural
        networks because it ignores the position and structure information between
        context words. The English machine translation model based on the self-attention
        mechanism uses sine and cosine position coding to represent the absolute position
        information of words in order to enable the model to use position information
        between words. This method, on the other hand, can reflect relative distance
        but does not provide directionality. As a result, a new model of English machine
        translation is proposed, which is based on the logarithmic position representation
        method and the self-attention mechanism. This model retains the distance and
        directional information between words, as well as the efficiency of the self-attention
        mechanism. Experiments show that the nonstrict phrase extraction method can
        effectively extract phrase translation pairs from the n-best word alignment
        results and that the extraction constraint strategy can improve translation
        quality even further. Nonstrict phrase extraction methods and n-best alignment
        results can significantly improve the quality of translation translations
        when compared to traditional phrase extraction methods based on single alignment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/2601480","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,23]],"date-time":"2021-12-23T21:58:36Z","timestamp":1640296716000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["English

        supervision involves the analysis of situations and decision making, some
        of which include ethical perspectives. This research endeavoured to gain a
        better understanding of the nature of the ethical problems encountered by
        supervisors. We have interviewed fourteen supervisors in two disciplines:
        the natural sciences and the behavioural sciences. We have identified the
        ethical issues in light of five ethical principles, namely respect for autonomy,
        non maleficence, beneficence, justice, and fidelity. We have located the ethical
        issues within the supervisory activity in two locations: the dyadic supervisor-student
        relationship and the academic community. The study shows that supervisors
        encounter a plethora of ethical issues. Many of the supervisors were highly
        aware of the ethical challenges in supervision and actively worked to anticipate
        and prevent ethical problems. The supervisors described a number of sustainable
        solutions, but at the same time, ethical problems and malpractice were reported.
        This suggests that the complexities of ethics are not always evident to the
        actors themselves. We claim that in order to expose and scrutinize supervision
        practices, it is insufficient to analyse the ethical issues only on dyadic
        level. What appears to boil down to a dyadic relationship may in fact be indicative
        of the values, attitudes, norms, and practices of the community.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2012\/961505","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,7]],"date-time":"2012-08-07T13:43:27Z","timestamp":1344347007000},"page":"1-12","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["The

        whole endocrinological aspect of PCa. During aging, metabolic syndrome, including
        diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and central obesity, can be associated
        with a chronic, low-grade inflammation of the prostate and with changes in
        the sex steroid pathways. These factors may affect both the carcinogenesis
        processes and treatment outcomes of PCa. Any treatment for PCa can have a
        long-lasting negative impact on quality of life and sexual health, which should
        be assessed by validated self-reported questionnaires. In particular, sexual
        health, urinary continence, and bowel function can be worsened after prostatectomy,
        radiotherapy, or hormone treatment, mostly in the elderly population. In the
        present review we summarized the current knowledge on the role of hormones,
        metabolic features, and primary treatments for PCa on the quality of life
        and sexual health of elderly Pca survivors.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2014\/470592","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2014,3,17]],"date-time":"2014-03-17T21:02:17Z","timestamp":1395090137000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Quality

        order to enable the micro-nanosatellites equipped with microthrusters to better
        complete various space applications, it is necessary to estimate the thrust
        performance of the microthrusters in real-time on orbit. This paper proposes
        a real-time on-orbit estimation method for microthrust based on high-precision
        orbit determination. By establishing a high-precision orbit dynamic model,
        the microthrust generated by a microthruster is modeled as a first-order Markov
        model, combined with a high-precision GNSS measuring device, and the satellite
        position is obtained through the cubature Kalman filter algorithm, velocity,
        and thrust real-time on-orbit estimates. For a thrust of 100\u2009\u03bcN,
        the error accuracy of the on-orbit estimation is 3.98%; for a thrust of 500\u2009\u03bcN,
        the error accuracy is 1.79%; for a thrust of 5\u2009mN, the error accuracy
        can be reduced to 1.43%; and when the thrust is 500\u2009\u03bcN, the accuracy
        of orbit determination is 16\u2009cm. This method solves the problem that
        the traditional on-orbit thrust estimation method cannot perform real-time
        on-orbit estimation of microthrust on the order of hundreds of \u03bcN. The
        real-time on-orbit estimation of microthrust of micro-nanosatellites equipped
        with microthrusters of the order of hundreds of micronewtons or even several
        mN to tens of mN has certain reference value.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/7733495","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]],"date-time":"2021-07-01T18:21:09Z","timestamp":1625163669000},"page":"1-15","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Real-Time

        spatial organization of the nucleus is a key determinant in all genome activities.
        However, the accurate measurement of the nuclear organization is still technically
        challenging. Here, the technology NucQuant we created previously was utilized
        to detect the variation of the nuclear organization, including the heterogeneity
        of the nuclear geometry, the change of the NPC distribution along different
        cell cycle stages during interphase, and the organization of the nucleolus.
        The results confirmed that not only the growth rate and the NPC distribution
        are influenced by the carbon source; the nuclear shape is also impacted by
        the carbon source. The nuclei lost their spherical geometry gradually when
        the cell was cultured from the most to a less favorable carbon source. We
        also discovered that the nucleolus prefers to locate at the nuclear periphery,
        which was called the \u201cgenes poor region,\u201d especially when the cells
        entered quiescence. Furthermore, the distribution of the NPC along the different
        stages during the interphase was analyzed. We proposed that with the growth
        of the cell, the nucleus would grow from the surface of the NE flanking the

        aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a powerful tool to expand the existing
        ground wireless network into aerial space. Since high mobility is an essential
        characteristic for UAV, it is important to carry out an accurate, real-time,
        and high-precision localization in terms of safe operation and communication
        link maintenance. The cellular network-based localization technology has provided
        UAV a solution with both high coverage and seamless connection. However, the
        complex channel environment between the UAV and terrestrial base station (BS)
        would have weakened the localization performance. To solve this problem, a
        two-stage channel adaptive algorithm for cellular-connected UAV has been proposed.
        The first stage of the algorithm is to revise the observation error introduced
        by the complex channel environment using the model of DDPG. The second stage
        is to locate the UAV position with TDOA algorithm using the revised observation
        values. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can
        achieve the channel adaptive effect by revising the observation errors and
        improve location performance greatly, especially for UAVs at a relative lower
        altitude.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/8946885","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,8]],"date-time":"2021-11-08T23:20:16Z","timestamp":1636413616000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Two-Stage

        aim of this study is to further investigate the effect of different basalt
        fiber (BF) factors on the viscoelastic equivalent creep behavior of fiber-reinforced
        asphalt mixture (FRAM) under indirect tensile (IDT) condition. A two-dimension
        mesostructural model composed of different components including fiber mortar
        polymer and coarse particle aggregate is constructed via the section image
        processing for the IDT FRAM specimen, where BF is considered as random distribution
        in the mortar polymer. Furthermore, the stress distribution and equivalent
        creep of the IDT mesostructural model in simulation software are analyzed
        to discuss the influence of components on the creep behavior of FRAM. Moreover,
        the laboratory creep test of IDT specimens under 0% and 0.3% BF contents for
        FRAM is carried out to validate the simulated values. Research results indicate
        that the simulated creep deformation of the IDT mesostructural model is in
        agreement with that of the experiment. Finally, creep simulations are further
        conducted to discuss the effect of BF (e.g., fiber content, length-diameter
        ratio, and fiber modulus) and aggregate on the creep characteristic of FRAM.
        The increase of fiber content and length-diameter ratio has a significant
        reinforcing effect on the equivalent mechanical behavior, but the change in
        the modulus of fiber and aggregate has slight effects.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/6682606","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]],"date-time":"2021-02-18T01:52:32Z","timestamp":1613613152000},"page":"1-13","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Viscoelastic

        with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its clinicopathologic significance
        is still unknown. A cohort of 304 patients undergoing surgical resection for
        HCC and having preoperative CA19-9 data was enrolled in this study. Serum
        CA19-9 levels were correlated with clinicopathologic factors. Univariate and
        multivariate analyses were performed to determine the predictors of patient
        survival. On receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cut off
        value of CA19-9 was determined to be 27\u2009U\/mL. One hundred and six patients
        had preoperative CA19-9 values &gt;27\u2009U\/mL. High serum CA19-9 levels
        did not correlate with patient age, sex, viral status,<jats:italic>\u03b1<\/jats:italic>-fetoprotein
        level, tumor size, tumor grade, tumor stage, multiplicity, and vascular invasion.
        Patients with elevated preoperative CA19-9 levels had lower 10-year survival
        than those without CA19-9 elevation. Multivariate analysis revealed that CA19-9
        level, tumor grade, and tumor size are independent prognostic factors for
        long-term survival. In conclusion, a preoperative CA19-9 value &gt;27\u2009U\/mL

        objective of this study was to compare the therapeutic response of intravesical
        oxybutynin, propantheline, and capsaicin in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor
        overactivity. Carried out in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
        at a university teaching hospital in India, patients acted as their own controls.
        Oxybutynin 5 mg in solution or propantheline 15 mg in solution and capsaicin
        were instilled intravesically in each patient. Urodynamic studies were done
        before and after the intravesical instillation of each drug. The nonparametric
        tests were used for statistical analysis. The efficacy of intravesical capsaicin
        in the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity was statistically significant
        for reflex volume (RV) (p = 0.018), cystometric capacity (CC) (p = 0.0440),
        leak volume (LV) (p = 0.000), and leak frequency (LF) (p = 0.009). The Kruskal-Wallis
        test for paired sample comparing pre- and post-LV and LF for intravesical
        capsaicin was significant at 2<jats:sup>nd<\/jats:sup>week (p = 0.002 and
        0.054, respectively). There was a significant difference in therapeutic response

        of detrusor overactivity for LV and LF at 2<jats:sup>nd<\/jats:sup>week (p
        = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively). When comparing responses of oxybutynin and
        propantheline, more subjects demonstrated improvement with intravesical propantheline
        than oxybutynin for RV, detrusor leak point pressure (LPP), clean intermittent
        catheterization volume (CICV), and LV. This study suggests that intravesical
        agents may be used as effective adjuvants in the management of incontinence

        the shock is not a common symptom of KD, it is often misdiagnosed at the beginning
        of the pathogenesis of KDSS. The language searched was only Chinese and English.
        Data from the articles were screened and extracted for meta-analysis using
        Stata16.0 software. A total of 9 cohort studies, including 1231 patients,
        were included in this meta-analysis. The results of meta-analysis showed that
        the age of the children in the KDSS group was higher than that in the KD group

        Compared with KD without shock, children with KDSS are older and have a higher
        incidence of coronary artery disease, serum CRP, and AST, but albumin is lower
        than KD without shock. According to these characteristics, it may be helpful
        for the early identification of KDSS.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2021\/1486089","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]],"date-time":"2021-12-20T22:36:32Z","timestamp":1640039792000},"page":"1-11","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Comparison

        mellitus is one of the most relevant noncommunicable diseases; the WHO figures
        in its latest update that 422 million people suffer from it; additionally,
        it has remained for more than 20 years within the 10 main causes of death
        worldwide; this disease affects the population at any age; glucose measurement
        is used to assist the treatment of this disease by different methods that
        are classified as invasive, minimally invasive, and noninvasive, the latter
        being an area of recent development due that it is not traumatic for patients.
        This work consists of the experimental characterization of an optical system
        for plasma glucometry using near infrared by spectrophotometry. This glucometry
        system is based on the employ of an infrared LED with a wavelength of 1650\u2009nm,
        a beam angle of 16\u00b0, and an output power of 1.6\u2009mW that passes through
        the analyte (glucose in blood plasma) that is contained in cuvettes of different
        materials (acrylic and quartz) to subsequently affect a photodiode with different
        active areas ranging from 0.06\u2009mm to 1.5\u2009mm in order to evaluate
        the efficiency by comparing the sensitivity in the presence of glucose making
        additions ranging 100\u2009mg\/dl\u20131000\u2009mg\/dl within a dark chamber.
        The experiments showed that the use of photodiodes with a larger active area
        and the use of quartz cuvettes show a higher sensitivity compared to photodiodes
        with small active areas and the use of acrylic cuvettes. This configuration
        presented an R2 of 0.99 and a sensitivity of 0.225\u2009mV\/1\u2009mg\/dl
        of glucose; despite the fact that the initial voltage in each of the experimental
        repetitions varies, the downward voltage pattern is maintained; based on this,
        it is concluded that this method using this setup is feasible for plasma glucose
        measurement.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2022\/5071553","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,4]],"date-time":"2022-02-04T18:35:16Z","timestamp":1643999716000},"page":"1-8","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Comparison

        syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly that involves several organs. Patients

        pulmonary valve stenosis, anomalies of genitalia, retardation of growth, and
        deafness. The syndrome is rare, and only 200 cases have been reported yet

        To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tongning Gel (TNG) compared to placebo-controlled
        (PC) for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). <jats:italic>Methods<\/jats:italic>. A
        multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled, clinical
        trial was performed in 576 patients (432 patients in the TNG group, 144 patients
        in the PC group), and 1 in the experimental group withdrew due to nonuse of
        drug. Patients were randomized to receive TNG or PC applied to knee skin at
        3g per time, 2 times per day, which lasted for 3 weeks. The Western Ontario
        and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain score was used to evaluate
        the primary efficacy of TNG and WOMAC stiffness and physical function and
        total scores were used to evaluate the secondary efficacy of TNG. All participants
        who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis.
        This trial has been registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (no. <jats:ext-link

        <jats:italic>Results<\/jats:italic>. Primary efficiency outcome: there were
        significant differences in the decreased value of WOMAC pain score between
        two groups (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>P<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>),
        and the decreased value of WOMAC pain score in the TNG group were better than

        Secondary efficiency outcome: the WOMAC total score, WOMAC stiffness score,
        WOMAC physical function score, and the decrease of the above indexes of the
        two groups of patients after treatment were statistically significant (<mml:math

        and the improvement of the above indexes in the TNG group was better than
        that of the PC group (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1998\/Math\/MathML\"
        id=\"M4\"><mml:mi>P<\/mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;<\/mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05<\/mml:mn><\/mml:math>).
        <jats:italic>Safety Evaluation<\/jats:italic>. A total of 42 adverse events
        were reported by 29 patients: 25 adverse events reported by 16 patients (3.71%)
        in the experimental group and 17 adverse events were reported by 13 patients
        (9.03%) in the control group. And 8 adverse reactions were reported by 6 patients
        including 2 adverse reactions by 2 patients (0.46%) in the experimental group
        and 6 adverse reactions by 4 patients (2.78%) in the control group. Two cases
        of significant adverse events occurred in the experimental group. Both groups
        had one serious adverse event, respectively, which were not relevant to the
        intervention. <jats:italic>Conclusion<\/jats:italic>. These results of the
        trial demonstrate that TNG is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients
        with KOA, and TNG can improve other symptoms of KOA, such as stiffness and
        physical function. TNG is safe for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis as
        a whole.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1155\/2020\/8707256","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,6,11]],"date-time":"2020-06-11T23:31:41Z","timestamp":1591918301000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Efficacy
